## 2026-07-12 — C2-2: captain level → stats adapter fold (dark)

**Request.** The CAPXP continuation (plan §C P5, after the 0177 foundation): the level-curve →
adapter parity delta — `calculate_expedition_stats` scales each assigned captain's stats
contribution by `(1 + (level-1) × level_bonus)`, byte-inert at level 1 AND while
`captain_growth_enabled` is dark. C2-3 XP bars + C2-4 the 6→8 slot raise = later slices.

**Work done**
- **Migration `20260618000180_c2_2_captain_level_fold.sql`** —
  - **True head found = 0170** (grep-verified: the only create sites are 0044 → 0115 → 0122 → 0170;
    0171..0179 never re-create it — 0159/0165/0166/0168 only call it). Re-created VERBATIM with the
    marked `C2-2 (0180)` delta: three added declares (flag + knob read ONCE at entry — never
    per-captain, so a mid-scan config write can't split one ship's roster across regimes), `i.level`
    added to the captain-loop join select (additive column), and the ONE hunk where captain stats
    fold in: `v_lvl_mult := case when v_growth then 1 + (c.level - 1) * v_lvl_bonus else 1 end`,
    with ` * v_lvl_mult` appended to the EIGHT stats_json contribution reads (7 accumulators +
    speed_mult_bonus). Extract-and-diff verified: the declares + the join column + the hunk only.
    Stated honestly in the header: unlike 0170's add-only shape, a multiplicative scale must MODIFY
    those eight lines.
  - **THE DOUBLE GATE:** while dark the multiplier is exactly 1.0 regardless of level; at level 1 it
    is exactly 1.0 regardless of the flag — so the delta is DOUBLY inert today (flag committed
    false AND every captain level 1 — the accrual, its sole writer, has only ever run dark). Knob
    floored at 0 and level ≥ 1 by the 0177 CHECK → the multiplier is never < 1 (leveling is never a
    nerf; the tradeoff CASE lines — attention/speed penalty — stay level-flat: growth is never a
    stealth cost raise).
  - **Knob `captain_level_bonus_per_level` seeded 0.10 [D owner-tunable]** — with the 0177 curve
    (level = 1 + floor(sqrt(xp/100))): level 2 (100 xp) = +10% on the captain-contributed portion
    (a level-2 gunnery_veteran contributes 4.4 attack instead of 4), level 3 = +20%, …
  - **Self-asserts:** knob at 0.10; flag still dark + zero captains above level 1 at migration time
    (a lit-early deploy fails closed, forcing a human decision); prosrc pins — the gated-multiplier
    token verbatim, `captain_level_bonus_per_level` read, `i.level` joined, EXACTLY 8 `* v_lvl_mult`
    scale sites (fewer = a dropped stat, more = a leak onto another pipeline), tradeoffs unscaled;
    adapter ACL still server-only. (No adapter spot-call in the migration — no fixture exists there;
    the prosrc pins + the CI proof carry the behavior.)
- **Proof: `TEAMCMD_PASS_CAPLEVEL` block** appended to `scripts/team-command-proof.sql` (after
  CAPXP, consuming its outcome AS the level-2 fixture — capa+capb at exactly level 2 on c1, capd at
  level 1 on the grantless b1, flag lit in-txn). All expectations derived INDEPENDENTLY from
  catalog/instance joins (the TEAMSTATS style): (1) LIT + LEVEL 2 — c1's combat_power exceeds the
  level-1 baseline by exactly `round(knob × Σ(level-1)×attack, 2)` (23 → 23.8 at the seeds) with
  every other key byte-identical (isolation pin); (2) FLAG OFF + LEVEL 2 — the level-1 world
  exactly (combat_power = hull attack + Σ captain attack, absolute); (3) FLAG ON + LEVEL 1 — b1
  byte-identical lit or dark. Plus a real-bonus guard (Σ(level-1)×attack must be > 0 — a 0=0
  compare can only false-green) and the committed-knob-untouched pin.
  - **Reconciliation (the C2-2 READ check):** the CAPXP block flips the flag and raises captains to
    level 2, but NO existing block calls the adapter after that point (grep: zero
    adapter/preview/totals calls past the TEAMSETTLE block; the flag flip postdates every
    adapter-calling block) — so every existing pin runs dark at level 1, where the 0180 multiplier
    is exactly 1.0 twice over, and stays byte-valid with NO fixture surgery.
- **`scripts/team-command-proof.sh`:** `TEAMCMD_PASS_CAPLEVEL` marker + 7 CAPLEVEL selftest greps
  in assert form. Mutation-tested: each of the 7 pins individually gutted → selftest FAILs; restored
  → green.

**Verify.** team-command selftest green; all other proof selftests green
(osn-hub1a-production-catalog-verify selftest fails identically on the clean tree — pre-existing,
environment-dependent, unrelated); `tsc -b` + `vite build` green (untouched). Real-chain run =
`team-command-proof.yml` disposable-matrix on the `slice-c2-2` push (no local Docker/psql — the
established norm).

**Open follow-ups**
- C2-3: XP bars in TeamMemberCaptains (reads `captain_instances.xp/level` — first client consumer).
- C2-4: the 6→8 captain-slot raise (separate additive migration, lit-time decision).
- ACT-CAPXP flip still owns the dark-backlog decision (0177 header) — and now also lights the
  level fold: flipping `captain_growth_enabled` activates BOTH accrual and the adapter bonus.

## 2026-07-12 — HAUL-2: the contract accept/deliver RPCs (dark)

**Request.** The HAUL continuation (plan §C P2, after the 0176 foundation): the accept/deliver
state-transition RPCs — `haul_accept_contract` + `haul_deliver_contract` — with receipts, the delivery
deadline, the active cap, and the expiry of accepted-but-undelivered contracts. Everything stays DARK
behind the same `haul_contracts_enabled` flag (no flag write). HAUL-3 UI + ACT-HAUL = later slices.

**Work done**
- **Migration `20260618000179_haul_accept_deliver.sql`** — the semantics decisions, each documented in
  the header:
  - **Accept is a CLAIM, not a transaction:** moves NO cargo and NO credits — the player sources the
    goods themselves (market buy at origin / existing cargo); exactly what the 0176 reward math prices
    in (reward > qty × origin.sell always — the worth-taking invariant covers the buy).
  - **Origin-port accept:** the bulletin is per-port — the resolved ship must be DOCKED (the ONE
    resolver 0092/0138) at the contract's origin; a contract elsewhere folds into `contract_not_found`.
    Offer expiry is ALSO checked at accept (fail-closed — never waits on the hourly cron's flip).
  - **Any-owned-ship deliver:** the contract is player-scoped (`accepted_by`); ANY owned ship docked at
    the DEST holding the goods delivers. `accepted_ship` = provenance only.
  - **deliver_by reconciliation:** 0176's `duration_seconds` anchored the OFFER pickup window and
    shipped NO delivery window. Decision: reuse the same knob as the delivery window —
    `deliver_by = accepted_at + duration_seconds` (the contract's TEMPO: 6h staples, 12h premium runs;
    one owner-tunable number, no reseed; a future wave can split it with a new column). A new CHECK
    pins every 'accepted' row to a non-null deliver_by (else it would hold a cap slot forever).
  - **Expiry shape (chosen):** the generator re-created from its 0176 head under PARITY DISCIPLINE —
    diff-verified byte-identical except THREE marked [HAUL-2 hunk] groups: the `v_cancelled` local, the
    (a2) pass ('accepted' past `deliver_by` → 'cancelled'; no penalty v1 [D]; frees the cap slot), and
    the `accepted_cancelled` envelope field. Chosen over a second cron function: one scheduled
    entrypoint, one gate, one envelope — the cron job untouched. Pass (a) stays offered-only
    (accepted rows are never 'expired'); (a2) is the SINGLE writer of accepted→cancelled — the deliver
    RPC rejects `deadline_passed` but never flips the row.
  - **`haul_receipts`** (0176 shipped NO receipts table — checked; explicitly deferred): the
    salvage_receipts 0174 shape point-for-point — unique (main_ship_id, request_id), ship-keyed,
    replay-verbatim; ONE table for BOTH actions (`action` discriminator) so a ship's request namespace
    is one idempotency domain (trade semantics, no payload-conflict check). `reward_credits` = credits
    actually moved by the action (0 on accept). Owner-read via the owning ship; sole writers = the two
    RPCs. New knob `haul_max_active_per_player` seeded 3 [D] (counts 'accepted' only, EXCLUDING the
    contract being re-accepted — so a replay at the cap works; 0 = freeze).
  - **Reject orders** (gate-first envelopes, the 0174 template): accept `not_authenticated` →
    `haul_contracts_disabled` → `invalid_request` → `ship_not_found` → per-ship lock → `not_docked` →
    `contract_not_found` (row FOR UPDATE — cross-player accept races serialize on the row lock;
    ship-lock-then-contract-lock everywhere, no deadlock cycle) → `already_accepted_other` →
    `too_many_active` → `idempotent_replay` → `already_accepted` (mine, fresh request) → ok. Deliver:
    … `not_docked` → `contract_not_found` → **`idempotent_replay` BEFORE the state/port/deadline/cargo
    guards** (a successful delivery flips the status AND consumes the cargo — a retry must replay,
    never bounce; the documented 0174-delta posture) → `contract_not_found` (not mine/not accepted) →
    `wrong_port` → `deadline_passed` → `insufficient_cargo` (inline lot-sum — the market_sell 0090
    read idiom) → ok: `trade_cargo_consume` (the ONE FIFO debiter; **cost basis consumed and LOST — the
    reward covers it**, reported as `cost_basis_consumed`) + `wallet_credit` + delivered flip + receipt,
    atomic. ACLs: both RPCs authenticated-only; every internal leaf stays client-revoked.
  - Self-asserts: deliver_by + CHECK; receipts RLS/grants exact; RPC identities + ACLs; internals still
    private; knob 3; flag STILL dark; generator parity spot-pins (offered-only expiry + salts + natural
    key + the (a2) predicate) + ACL; cron still exactly once; dark dry-runs — generator no-op envelope
    zero-delta, RPCs `not_authenticated` with no subject and `haul_contracts_disabled` gate-first under
    a transient fake JWT, zero receipts.
- **Proof `scripts/haul-proof.{sql,sh}` extended** (same one-BEGIN..ROLLBACK harness; fixture ships via
  the real `commission_first_main_ship`, travel via the real move command + rewind + the REAL arrival
  processor, wallets pre-set to a known 100 — the tm1/sv1 funding precedent): P0 + dark RPC rejects
  (`haul_contracts_disabled`, zero receipts) → P1 also pins deliver_by NULL pre-accept → P4 accepted
  fixture now carries a future deliver_by (the 0179 CHECK) and pins `accepted_cancelled=0` — immunity
  of within-deadline accepted rows to BOTH passes → P5 + haul_receipts policy/grants + RPC ACLs +
  internal-leaf privacy → **P6 ACCEPT** (origin-port happy path: deliver_by = accepted_at + duration
  EXACT recompute, zero cargo/credit movement, receipt exact, replay verbatim) → **P6b guards**
  (`already_accepted` self, `already_accepted_other`, wrong-port + fixture-aged stale-offer
  `contract_not_found` fail-closed, `too_many_active` at a transient cap 1 WITH replay-at-cap intact —
  all zero-write) → **P7 DELIVER** (wrong_port at the origin, foreign `contract_not_found`, empty-hold
  `insufficient_cargo`; fixture cargo qty+2 through the REAL `trade_cargo_add_lot` leaf at the origin's
  live sell price — direct ship_cargo_lots writes selftest-BANNED; happy path: wallet +reward EXACT on
  the known 100, cargo −qty exact (remainder 2), FIFO `cost_basis_consumed` = qty × basis exact,
  delivered flip + receipt; replay verbatim, no cost field, no doubles) → **P8 DEADLINE+CANCEL**
  (data-driven second accept at the ship's current port; fixture-aged deliver_by; `deadline_passed`
  reject-only zero-write; generator run: `accepted_cancelled=1`, the slot FREED (active count 0), the
  within-deadline accepted row untouched again, zero expiries/mints). New markers: HAUL_PASS_ACCEPT /
  _ACCEPT_GUARDS / _DELIVER_GUARDS / _DELIVER / _DEADLINE_CANCEL. Selftest greps extended: RPC
  invocations, dark rejects, deliver_by anchor recompute, claim-moves-nothing pins, all guard tokens,
  exact wallet delta, cost-basis pin, cancel-frees-slot pin, receipts-insert + ship_cargo_lots-write
  bans, cargo-leaf requirement.
- **Docs:** SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES §1 haul_contracts row (writers COMPLETE and closed: the three functions)
  + new haul_receipts row; §2 Haul Contracts system row (both RPCs' full reject orders + the (a2) pass
  + updated never-list). FULL_CAPACITY_PLAN §C P2 + queue row 12 → HAUL-2 shipped (dark); trailing
  resequence note → HAUL-3 + flip remain.

**Verification.** `bash scripts/haul-proof.sh selftest` green; **mutation-tested 14/14 caught**
(commit-instead-of-rollback, flag-enable dropped, direct haul_contracts insert, dark-RPC-reject pin
gutted, cargo-leaf call renamed away, direct ship_cargo_lots write, deliver_by anchor gutted,
replay-at-cap pin dropped, deadline-cancel marker dropped, exact-wallet-delta gutted, SQL after the
final rollback, direct haul_receipts insert, accepted-immunity pin dropped, (a2)-envelope pin
dropped), control green. All seven lib-consumer selftests green (six trade-family + team-command).
Generator parity diff-verified: 0176 → 0179 differs by EXACTLY the three marked hunks. `tsc`/`vite
build` untouched-green (no client code). Real-chain run = the `trade-v1-proof.yml` disposable matrix
on push (slice-haul** trigger covers slice-haul2). NOT committed/pushed (per instruction).

## 2026-07-12 — COORD-GUARD (queue #14.5): the A0-fix + the coordinate-travel flip script

**Request.** The pre-activation slice that makes the free-coordinate-travel flip safe: resolver-guard
the raw coordinate command (the standing "A0-fix" debt, docs/TEAM_COMMAND.md), then ship the
activate-family flip script for `mainship_coordinate_travel_enabled`. Motivation (WORLD_RECON_F1 §7):
exploration/mining sites sit out to ±4200 and need a settled `in_space` ship within 750 units, while
the only dockable anchors are the three 0066 port anchors (−50,−30)/(70,−10)/(10,80) — computed from
the seeds, the NEAREST site ('Derelict Listening Post' (−1200,850)) is ~1,434 units from the nearest
anchor (10,80), nearly double the radius, so those rungs are UNREACHABLE until this flag flips; the
farthest site from its nearest anchor ('Precursor Vault Signal' (−4100,3600)) is ~5,411 units ≈
5,411 s at base_speed 1.0 — one legal jump under the 86,400 s cap. But the flag's command,
`command_main_ship_space_move` (head 0070), still derived the ship with the pre-multi-ship unguarded
`where player_id = v_player` (deferred by 0C's §2.5 [C] row because the coordinate gate rejected before
the read). Multi-ship is LIVE (24-ship cap, commissioning lit) — flipping without the guard lights an
arbitrary-ship read.

**Work done**
- **Migration `20260618000178_coord_guard_a0fix.sql`** — parity re-create from the grep-verified TRUE
  head (create-sites: 0060 → 0070; nothing later): trailing `p_main_ship_id uuid default null` (the
  0081/0159 idiom; drop + recreate) and step 3's unguarded read swapped for
  `mainship_resolve_owned_ship(v_player, p_main_ship_id)` — explicit id → ownership-asserted, null →
  sole-ship shim, N≠1 → fail-closed `no_ship` (verbatim shape). Diff-verified: the function body
  differs from 0070 by EXACTLY the step-3 comment + resolver swap; every single-ship player is
  byte-identical end to end. ACLs re-asserted on the new identity (authenticated-only). Self-asserts:
  4-arg identity exists, 3-arg gone (no overload), resolver CALL in prosrc, unguarded read gone, both
  flag gates still precede the resolution, ACL, resolver head present. Backward compatible: id-less
  callers resolve via the trailing default → shim. Signature-pin repoints (the pins §#1 had recorded
  as "remain valid") appended COMPLETE to docs/TRADE_FLEET_0C_VERIFIER_REPOINT.md §#1 for the
  deploy-time human gate — the regprocedure/privilege pins PLUS the arg-type-OID census
  (osn-postenable-verify.sql:176-181 COORD_SURFACE_COUNT, pronargs 3→4 + proargtypes[3]=uuid;
  .sh:89/:135 consumers) and the exact-args + SECURITY-INTENT asserts (osn3-s6a-realchain-perm.sql:28,
  :34 and osn3-s6a-live-check.sh:62,:65 — the :34/:65 "no ship id param" intent is now deliberately
  false and gets a SEMANTIC rewrite: 'player' still absent, the sole ship arg is the trailing
  ownership-resolved p_main_ship_id). No verifier file edited. Scope note: this closes the last
  unguarded read on the OSN MOVEMENT surface; a separate read-only pre-multi-ship read remains in
  `commission_first_main_ship` (0072:117,129 — arbitrary-row CLASSIFICATION at N>1, not exploitable;
  tiny follow-up queued in docs/TEAM_COMMAND.md).
- **Client passthrough (same slice — the multi-ship UX half of the guard):** the S6C tap flow now
  sends the SELECTED ship. Without it, a multi-ship player would get a LIT coordinate UI (readiness
  is ship-scoped) whose every move answers `no_ship`. Following the Stop pattern exactly:
  `buildSpaceMoveRpcArgs` gains `p_main_ship_id` (null-defaulted; spaceMoveCommand.ts),
  `commandMainShipSpaceMove` gains the trailing `mainShipId` param (mainshipApi.ts),
  `useSpaceMoveCommand` gains the `mainShipId` override + `[mainShipId]` controller-recreation key
  (useSpaceMoveCommand.ts — the stop hook's exact lifecycle), and GalaxyMap threads
  `mainShip?.main_ship_id ?? null` — the SAME source as the stop command and the readiness read, so
  the move targets the ship the readiness was scoped to. tests/spaceMoveCommand.spec.ts extended:
  exactly FOUR payload keys, the only ship-matching key is `p_main_ship_id`, no player/location/
  target_kind key, omitted/null ship id → explicit `p_main_ship_id: null` (the shim wire shape).
  Dark until the flip → zero live-behavior change today.
- **`scripts/activate-coordinate-travel.{sql,sh}`** (activate-captains idiom) — PRECONDITIONS: head ≥
  0178 recorded; the guarded body live via the prosrc pin PAIR (the resolver-CALL assignment token +
  the unguarded-read-GONE negative check — the pair is the teeth — plus old-3-arg-gone); stop guarded
  (0083); `get_osn_movement_readiness(uuid)` present with the `coordinate_travel_available` derivation;
  flag key exists; site/field counts + an anchors-nonempty assert (a NULL distance record must not
  pass as proof) + the LIVE-computed min anchor→site distance printed as the reachability record.
  STAGE 1 (the ONE write):
  `mainship_coordinate_travel_enabled` → true via `set_game_config`. SMOKE (read-only): committed
  value + cfg_bool + the movement-domain flag still true, readiness capability, move+stop guarded
  prosrc, ACL sanity, every site/field inside the ±10000 envelope. Markers + PASS line. Commented
  flag-only ROLLBACK with the verified in-flight-settle citation: `process_mainship_space_arrivals`
  (head 0064:95) reads NO flag; `command_main_ship_settle_arrival` (0150:66) gates only on
  `mainship_space_movement_enabled`; the stop writer only branches on a flag when NOT in transit
  (0064:250-259); grep-verified the coordinate flag's ONLY readers are the move command + the
  readiness projection. **NO client PR** (verified): coordinate targeting is driven SOLELY by the
  server-derived `coordinate_travel_available` — osnReleaseGates.ts:5-16 (compile const RETIRED),
  osnReadiness.ts:63 + isCoordinateTargetingActionable (81-91), GalaxyMap.tsx:93-101 (`canTarget`).
  Selftest mutation-tested: 9 mutations (flag→false, second write, marker drop, pin drop, direct table
  write, uncommented rollback, precondition drop, psql meta-command, no-client-PR-note drop) — all 9
  flip it to FAIL; the clean file passes.
- **Docs**: FULL_CAPACITY_PLAN — Rung 0.5 inserted in the ladder (exploration/mining rungs now marked
  REQUIRES Rung 0.5) + queue row #14.5 shipped (+ #14 marked shipped); TEAM_COMMAND A0-fix debt note
  marked RESOLVED; TRADE_FLEET_0C_VERIFIER_REPOINT §#1 converted with the repoint table.

**Verification (this sandbox, honest).** New selftest green + all 9 mutations fatal; every existing
activate-*/proof/frozen-verifier selftest still green; the full pure spec battery green including the
extended spaceMoveCommand spec (the 4-key payload proofs); `npm run build` (tsc + vite) green. No local
DB (Docker down) — the migration apply remains the human deploy gate, per house convention.

## 2026-07-12 — CAPXP-0/1 (queue #13): captain-XP foundation (dark)

**Request.** Queue slice #13 of the full-capacity plan (§C P5): the captain-XP foundation —
C2-0 (additive `captain_instances.xp/level` + `captain_growth_enabled` dark flag) + C2-1 (XP
accrual as a downward reader of FINALIZED `reward_grants`, the commit-safe 0144/0145 anti-join
idiom with a `captain_counted_grants` ledger). The level-curve adapter delta (C2-2), the XP-bar UI
(C2-3), and the 6→8 slot raise (C2-4) are LATER slices. Everything dark; no client code.

**Work done**
- **Migration `20260618000177_captain_xp_foundation.sql`**:
  - `captain_instances` gains additive `xp numeric not null default 0` + `level integer not null
    default 1` — **read by NOTHING yet** (no adapter/RPC/client touches them until C2-2/C2-3);
    the mint (0118) and assignment (0119) writers ride the defaults and never touch either column.
  - **THE SHIP-LINKAGE FINDING** (`reward_grants` carries NO ship column — the linkage is
    per-source via `source_id`): **combat** = encounter id → `combat_encounters.fleet_id` → the
    frozen `group_sortie_members` manifest (0168 — the charter's "sorties whose manifest included
    the captain's ship") ∪ the `fleets.main_ship_id` tag (0050) for solo sorties; **exploration** =
    `exploration_discoveries.main_ship_id` (0146/0172 securing link; nullable — legacy null-scanner
    rows underivable); **mining** = `mining_extractions.main_ship_id` (nullable — 0103 ON DELETE SET NULL; a destroyed-ship extraction consumes as a sentinel; review M1 corrected the earlier NOT-NULL claim); **trade** = NO reward_grants producer exists today (trade pays through Wallet) —
    if one appears its grants consume as sentinels until a linkage+knob slice defines them. Grants
    with no derivable ship (legacy unit fleets, retention-cleaned encounters) are consumed as
    SENTINELS, never credited.
  - **`captain_counted_grants`** — the 0144 consumption-ledger idiom, captain-shaped: keyed
    `unique nulls not distinct (grant_id, captain_instance_id)` (one grant can feed MULTIPLE
    captains on one manifest — each credit its own exactly-once row) with a **NULL-captain
    SENTINEL** marking "consumed, no credit". The accrual anti-joins per GRANT (no ledger row at
    all), so every grant is examined EXACTLY ONCE ever: bounded scans, and **no retroactive XP
    backfill** — a grant's captain set is fixed the first time the accrual sees it. Server-only
    (RLS on, no client policy/grant — the 0144 posture).
  - **`captain_xp_accrue()`** (SECURITY DEFINER, service-role-only): gate-FIRST →
    `{ok:false, code:'feature_disabled'}` while dark (a cron-safe no-op, NEVER a raise — the
    D2/0145 lesson) → global advisory lock → ONE commit-safe statement (the 0145 data-modifying-CTE
    shape): unconsumed grants → derivable ships → captains **currently assigned**
    (`ship_captain_assignments`) → ledger insert (credits + sentinels, `on conflict do nothing`) →
    per-captain Σxp folded into `captain_instances.xp` with `level = 1 + floor(sqrt(xp/100))`
    maintained inline (coherent from day one; the C2-2 adapter ignores it until its own slice).
  - **THE DESIGN-HONESTY NOTE (current-assignment vs at-sortie):** XP goes to captains assigned
    AT ACCRUAL TIME, not at sortie time — the manifest freezes at-send SHIP membership, but
    **captain-at-sortie-time is recorded nowhere** (nothing snapshots the roster at send), so
    current-assignment is the only derivable semantic. Practical skew ≈ one 5-min cron window; a
    D-family manifest extension (per-member captain snapshots written by `send_ship_group_hunt`)
    would enable true at-sortie attribution — noted as a future refinement, deliberately not built
    in a dark XP slice. Corollary documented for the future ACT-CAPXP flip: dark-era grants are
    all unconsumed, so the FIRST lit run folds that whole backlog into current assignees — the
    activation script must accept the one-time backfill or pre-seed sentinels (flip-time decision).
  - **XP formula [D, owner-tunable]:** flat XP per grant per source — a grant IS the finalized
    unit of "a sortie that came home with something" (UNIQUE (source_type, source_id)); knobs
    `captain_xp_per_combat_grant=10`, `captain_xp_per_exploration_grant=6`,
    `captain_xp_per_mining_grant=4`; every assigned captain on a linked ship gets the FULL amount
    (no split). Curve [D proposed]: `level = 1 + floor(sqrt(xp/100))` — 100→2, 400→3, 900→4.
  - **Cron `captain-xp-accrue`, every 5 min** (the 0147 idiom + cadence rationale verbatim:
    freshness only, never correctness — the ledger anti-join folds any backlog next firing).
    Scheduled NOW, zero live effect while dark.
  - Self-asserts: columns exist NOT NULL with defaults 0/1 and every instance rides them; ledger
    exists server-only; accrual exists service-role-only; cron scheduled exactly once; flag dark +
    knobs 10/6/4; and the cron-safety pin — a dark dry-run returns the no-op envelope, zero ledger
    rows, zero xp movement.
- **Proof — `TEAMCMD_PASS_CAPXP` block appended to `scripts/team-command-proof.{sql,sh}`**
  (captain/team-family; consumes the TEAMSETTLE fixture AS the captained team sortie — the settled
  uC sortie's grant, manifest {c1,c2}, with the TEAMHUNT roster still assigned: 2 captains on c1,
  1 on c2, 1 on the grantless b1): committed seeds pinned (flag 'false', knob '10'); additive
  defaults on every instance; DARK accrue = clean no-op envelope with ZERO writes **while grants
  already exist** (a gate-after-read regression would fold them); flag on in-txn + knob raised to
  100 via the real `set_game_config` (100 = the exact level-2 boundary) → ONE run credits the 3
  currently-assigned manifest captains EXACTLY knob × 1 qualifying grant each, level lands exactly
  2 at the boundary; a captain on a grantless ship and a freshly-minted UNASSIGNED captain gain
  NOTHING; an ORPHAN grant (minted via the REAL `reward_grant` sole writer with a random source_id
  — the retention-cleaned-encounter shape) consumes as a NULL-captain sentinel; zero grants left
  unconsumed; the curve recomputed independently over every instance; RE-RUN = all-zero envelope,
  ledger unchanged, total xp unchanged (the anti-join exactly-once pin). The `.sh` gains the
  marker, `captain_growth_enabled` in the flags-inside-txn list, 16 assert-form selftest greps,
  `captain_counted_grants` in the Captain-table negative grep (sole-writer law), and post-run
  committed-value honesty checks for the flag AND the xp knob (must stay 'false'/'10').
- **`SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`** — §1 row for `captain_counted_grants` (sole writer = the accrual;
  server-only) + the `captain_instances` row now states the disjoint-by-column writer split (mint
  owns row creation, `captain_xp_accrue` owns xp/level — mint/assign never touch them) + the §2
  Captain row gains the accrual, its downward edges (Reward/Combat/Movement/Team-Command/
  Exploration/Mining reads), and the forbidden edges (no XP writes outside the accrual; Combat
  never writes captain XP mid-tick).
- **Docs** — plan queue row 13 + ROADMAP phase row 24 → shipped (dark), both carrying the
  current-assignment note and the ACT-CAPXP dark-backlog decision.

**Verification.** `bash scripts/team-command-proof.sh selftest` green (the hardened lib);
**mutation-tested 7/7 caught** (flag-flip dropped, boundary assert gutted, PASS marker dropped,
direct ledger insert (sole-writer law), curve recompute gutted, re-run pin gutted, sentinel pin
gutted), control green. All six trade-family selftests green (untouched consumers of the shared
lib). `tsc`/`vite build` untouched-green (no client code). Real-chain run = the
`team-command-proof.yml` disposable matrix on push (`slice-**` trigger; this machine has no
Docker/psql — the established loop).

## 2026-07-12 — HAUL-0/1 (queue #12): delivery-contracts foundation (dark)

**Request.** Queue slice #12 of the full-capacity plan (§C P2): the retention loop's foundation —
HAUL-0 (`haul_contracts` schema + migration-seeded templates + `haul_contracts_enabled` dark flag) +
HAUL-1 (the cron-driven, seeded-deterministic offer generator). The accept/deliver RPCs (HAUL-2) and
the bulletin UI (HAUL-3) are LATER slices. Everything dark; no client code.

**Work done**
- **Migration `20260618000176_haul_contracts_foundation.sql`**:
  - `haul_contract_templates` — Reference/Config (migration-seeded ONLY, public read-only): 10 v1
    templates over the 0173 three-port economy carrying origin/dest (fixed uuid or NULL='any'),
    good, qty range, reward params, duration (6–12h), and generation weight. **Reward math [D,
    owner-tunable]:** `reward = round(reward_base + qty × (LIVE dest market_offers.buy_price +
    reward_premium_per_unit))` — beats the best same-haul self-trade (`qty × (dest.buy −
    origin.sell)`) by exactly `base + qty × premium` > 0, always, and MODESTLY (premiums ≈15–25% of
    the route's per-unit market profit; the full 10-row table with profit ranges lives in the 0176
    header). Two Drift-origin BACKHAULS ride market-dead 0173 routes (Drift is a pure importer) —
    the port pays above market to move goods raw arbitrage won't; smallest payouts on the board.
    Every qty_max fits the 50 m³ starter hold (self-asserted). Scale: a full day's board = 6
    contracts ≈ 300–900 profit — a retention garnish beside the repeatable +200/trip guaranteed
    routes, not a dominant faucet.
  - `haul_contracts` — the live offers: status domain offered/accepted/delivered/expired/cancelled,
    natural key `unique (origin_location_id, offer_day, slot)`, HAUL-2 columns (accepted_by/
    accepted_ship/accepted_at/delivered_at) ready but unwritten. RLS: 'offered' rows PUBLIC
    (per-port bulletins, no player data); accepted rows OWNER-only (`accepted_by = auth.uid()`);
    no client write path. Sole writer today = the generator; the only future writers = HAUL-2.
  - **`haul_generate_offers()`** (SECURITY DEFINER, service-role-only): gate-FIRST →
    `{ok:false, code:'feature_disabled'}` while dark — a cron-safe no-op, NEVER a raise (the D2/0145
    lesson). **Determinism = the 0041 technique** (pure function of inputs, no session RNG), extended
    with a pure hash: `hashtextextended('haul:'||day||':'||port||':'||slot, 0)` → uniform → weighted
    template pick (cumulative weights in template_id order); a second salt (`haulqty:`) → quantity.
    Same (day, port, slot) ⇒ byte-identical offer; idempotency is structural (the natural key +
    `on conflict do nothing` — re-runs and racing double-fires mint nothing). Generates N per active
    port per day (N = new knob `haul_offers_per_port`, seeded 2; active = status active + docking
    active + an active market — so ECON-SEED feeds both the pricing and the port filter). The expiry
    pass flips 'offered'→'expired' past `expires_at`; the predicate is status='offered' ONLY —
    **accepted contracts are never touched** (an accepted contract's delivery deadline is HAUL-2's
    business; design decision, proof-pinned).
  - **Cron `haul-generate-offers`, hourly (`'7 * * * *'`)** — cadence decision: offers are
    daily-deterministic (generation does real work once per day; every other firing is an idempotent
    no-op), but offer durations are 6–12h (sub-day), so the hourly firing is what keeps the bulletin
    honest — expiry latency ≤1h; daily would strand dead offers for hours, faster than hourly buys
    nothing. The 0033/0147 idiom verbatim; minute 7 avoids the top-of-hour herd. Scheduled NOW with
    zero live effect while dark.
  - Self-asserts: exactly the 10 approved templates; per-port pools non-empty; starter-haulable;
    worth-taking recomputed from the LIVE market rows at BOTH qty endpoints; generator exists +
    service-role-only ACL; cron scheduled exactly once; flag dark + knob 2; and the cron-safety
    pin — a dark dry-run of the generator returns the no-op envelope and leaves zero rows.
- **Proof `scripts/haul-proof.{sql,sh}`** (trade-family, lib-based, one BEGIN..ROLLBACK; wired as
  the 6th selftest + matrix step in `trade-v1-proof.yml`, trigger `slice-haul**`): P0 dark cron-safe
  no-op (envelope, zero rows, no raise) → flag on in-txn → P1 exactly N×3 offers, all 'offered',
  slots 1..N per port, template bounds + LIVE reward recompute + expiry anchor exact → P2
  worth-taking (contract profit beats the recomputed same-haul self-trade AND is absolute-positive —
  covers the backhauls) → P3 determinism (same-day re-run creates 0 rows, offer-set signature
  unchanged; the Haven slot-1 identity RE-DERIVED from the raw hash technique, not by calling the
  generator) → P4 expiry (a fixture-aged offered row flips 'expired'; a past-deadline 'accepted'
  fixture is NEVER touched; zero new mints) → P5 RLS/ACL shape (2 SELECT-only policies pinned by
  name+qual, templates public-read, zero client write grants, generator ACL, cron exactly once).
  The harness never INSERTs into either haul table (all rows come from the real generator; two
  marked fixture UPDATEs only) — selftest-pinned.
- **`SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`** — §1 rows for both tables (owners, sole writers, read surfaces) + a §2
  Haul Contracts system row (the charter guard: Contracts owns ONLY its table (+ future receipts);
  cargo moves only through Trade-Cargo, credits only through Wallet — HAUL-0/1 writes neither).
  ROADMAP phase row 22 + plan queue row 12 → shipped (dark).

**Hostile-review fixes (applied same slice; cron-safety/determinism/economics/schema reviewed CLEAN):**
- **M1 (shared lib `scripts/lib/trade-proof-lib.sh` — hardens ALL SEVEN lib consumers):** a flag
  toggle appended AFTER a proof's final `rollback;` AUTOCOMMITS in psql and previously SURVIVED the
  selftests — `tp_assert_flags_inside_txn` checked only the FIRST occurrence per flag and
  `tp_assert_self_rolling_back` only that the last txn VERB was rollback. Fixed both: EVERY
  occurrence of each flag toggle must now sit strictly inside begin;..rollback; (loop over all
  `grep -n` matches), and NOTHING but comments/whitespace may follow the final ROLLBACK (on its own
  line or any later one — comment-stripped check). Reconciliation: all seven lib-sourcing selftests
  (six trade-family + team-command) re-run GREEN unchanged — no existing proof carried trailing SQL
  or an out-of-txn toggle, so no proof needed adjustment.
- **L1 (0176 GUC-stable determinism):** the hash salts rendered the day via `format('%s', date)`
  (DateStyle-dependent) and the day boundary used `now()` (TimeZone-dependent). Now: the day is the
  UTC calendar day `(now() at time zone 'utc')::date` and enters both salts via
  `to_char(day, 'YYYY-MM-DD')` — no session GUC can shift an offer's identity between cron, psql,
  and the proof. The proof's P1/P3/P4 day derivations + the P3 inline re-derivation updated in
  exact lockstep; new selftest greps pin the to_char rendering + the UTC boundary.
- **L3 (0176 templates):** added `check (reward_base + reward_premium_per_unit > 0)` — a future 0/0
  template would make the worth-taking invariant a tie and could round a sub-0.5 reward to 0 → a
  lit-cron insert raise on `reward_credits > 0`.
- **Forward notes (0176 header + here):** (1) PRICE DRIFT — when `world_balance_enabled` lights, the
  P19 drift multiplier composes into the player's ACTUAL buy/sell prices at read time but NOT into
  contract rewards (priced at generation from the static `market_offers` rows); HAUL-2/HAUL-3 must
  surface the EFFECTIVE profit, not the static header math. (2) EMERGENCY DARKENING — a lit→dark
  flip freezes the expiry pass too (gate-first returns before it), so stale 'offered' rows persist
  publicly readable; the eventual ACT-HAUL rollback section must run one manual expiry pass (the
  generator's expiry UPDATE, as service role) or explicitly accept the frozen bulletin.

**Verification.** `bash scripts/haul-proof.sh selftest` green; **mutation-tested 14/14 caught**
(commit-instead-of-rollback, flag-enable dropped, direct haul_contracts insert, feature_disabled
envelope gutted, hash re-derivation removed, self-trade recompute gutted, accepted-row pin dropped,
PASS marker dropped, pg_policies asserts dropped, migrations-path reference; post-lib-fix: the M1
survivor post-rollback flag toggle, post-rollback arbitrary SQL, same-line post-rollback SQL, and
the to_char GUC pin gutted — the survivor also re-tested CAUGHT on salvage, proving the lib-wide
fix), controls green. All seven lib-consumer selftests green (six trade-family + team-command).
`tsc`/`vite build` untouched-green (no client code). Real-chain run = the `trade-v1-proof.yml`
disposable matrix on push (slice-haul trigger).

## 2026-07-12 — RANK-SEASON + ACT-RANKING (queue #9): the ranking activation script

**Request.** Queue slice #9 of the full-capacity plan (§B rung 5): `scripts/activate-ranking.{sql,sh}`
in the proven activate-* idiom. NO migration — the ranking stack is fully built dark (0127–0131 schema +
`ranking_season_open` + accrual + read surface; 0144/0145 the commit-safe `ranking_counted_grants`
ledger fold; 0147 the 5-min `ranking-accrue-standings` cron, already scheduled as a dark no-op;
RankingPanel server-lit). The script IS the flip: seasons + `ranking_enabled` → true.

**Work done**
- **`scripts/activate-ranking.sql`** — one all-or-nothing BEGIN..COMMIT (txn-local **UTC** — the
  window anchors are UTC-defined), zero psql meta-commands. PRECONDITIONS (read-only): head ≥ `0147` +
  all 8 ranking migrations recorded; the 3 tables + both season-invariant indexes; the whole function
  surface via `to_regprocedure` with the REAL signatures — `ranking_season_open(text, timestamptz,
  timestamptz, text)` (explicit bounds + label; it does NOT compute windows), `ranking_accrue_standings()`,
  `ranking_score_delta(jsonb)`, and the two client RPCs rankingApi.ts actually calls,
  `get_ranking_seasons()` + `get_ranking_leaderboard(uuid, text, int)` (there is NO
  get_my_rankings/get_my_standing — own standing is client-derived by design); the DEPLOYED accrual
  body prosrc-pinned TWICE to the 0145 commit-safe ledger fold (`ranking_counted_grants` + the
  `on conflict (season_id, grant_id) do nothing` exactly-once guard — the stale-0130
  timestamp-cursor body carries neither); the cron scheduled EXACTLY once (jobname
  `ranking-accrue-standings`, command invoking the accrual); the `ranking_enabled` key exists (value
  NOT asserted — re-runs are supported); `reward_grants` readable with per-dimension counts **FYI
  only, never a gate** (ranking lights before grants flow; trade has no depositor yet — 0128).
- **STAGE ORDER FINDING — flag BEFORE seasons (inverts the task sketch, forced by the code):**
  `ranking_season_open` dark-gates on `cfg_bool('ranking_enabled')` FIRST (0129:71) and answers
  `feature_disabled` while false — a season physically cannot be opened dark. So STAGE 1 = the one
  `set_game_config('ranking_enabled','true')` write; STAGE 2 = the seasons; both in the ONE txn so a
  season failure rolls the flag back too (never a lit flag without seasons).
- **Season windows [D proposed, owner-tunable], computed from now() at run time:** weekly =
  ISO-Monday-anchored `date_trunc('week', now())` .. +7 days, label `IYYY-"W"IW` (e.g. `2026-W28`);
  monthly = calendar month .. +1 month, label `YYYY-MM` (e.g. `2026-07`). Future rolls must reuse the
  convention so windows tile and the (cadence, starts_at) replay-idempotency (0129) holds.
- **RE-RUN SEMANTICS (decided): no-op success, and a later re-run IS the manual roll.** Each cadence
  is created ONLY if no CURRENT active season exists (active AND window containing now()): same-window
  re-run skips with a notice; a later-window re-run proceeds and `ranking_season_open` closes the
  expired active season while opening the new window. Envelopes asserted `ok` + `status='active'` —
  the edge where a CLOSED identical window replays verbatim (0129 never reactivates) fails LOUDLY
  instead of committing a lit flag with a dead board.
- **AUTO-ROLL FINDING: none exists.** The sole `ranking_seasons` writer is `ranking_season_open`
  (closes the prior active only when opening the next); the only ranking cron is the 5-min ACCRUAL.
  A season stays `active` past `ends_at` and the accrual's `granted_at between starts_at and ends_at`
  join simply stops folding — the board silently FREEZES. Season rolling is MANUAL for now (Monday
  00:00 UTC / 1st of month; a script re-run is the roll) — noted as an operational item + a future
  **RANK-ROLL** automation slice (safe: the opener is idempotent per (cadence, starts_at)). **Edges the roller must close (review M1/L1): fold recently-closed seasons for a grace tick (the status=active join drops post-roll late commits into NEITHER season), and make the window join half-open (BETWEEN double-counts an exact-boundary grant into both).**
- **SMOKE (read-only):** flag committed (raw + `cfg_bool`); exactly one active season per cadence with
  a window containing now(); cron intact exactly once; standings + counted-grants selectable (0 rows
  FYI); the CLIENT surface answers lit — `get_ranking_seasons()` {ok, ≥2} and
  `get_ranking_leaderboard(weekly, 'overall')` {ok} (empty rows = the honest "No standings yet" state).
  Markers `ACTIVATE_RANKING_PASS_*` + final PASS line.
- **MOUNT VERIFIED — NO client PR:** RankingPanel is already mounted on the post-R3 CommandScreen
  aside rail (`CommandScreen.tsx:83`, inside `screenRailClass('aside')`), gated ONLY by
  `isServerLit(seasons) && litSeasons.length > 0` (RankingPanel.tsx:87); no RANKING_* compile constant
  exists in `osnReleaseGates.ts` or anywhere in src (grep-verified). At flip time players see the
  Leaderboard card with both seasons and "No standings yet"; boards fill as the 5-min cron folds
  finalized `reward_grants` (combat/exploration/mining deposit as those systems light; the trade
  dimension stays 0 until a trade activity deposits grants).
- **ROLLBACK (commented, flag-only — recommended and reasoned):** `ranking_enabled` → false; standings
  freeze intact (every ranking RPC + the cron reject-before-read). Seasons are deliberately LEFT
  ACTIVE: closing is effectively one-way (the 0129 replay returns a closed row verbatim, never
  reactivates), so a re-light inside the same window would fold nothing; active-but-dark seasons are
  unreachable and the ledger anti-join BACKFILLS in-window grants on re-light — no gap, no double-count.
- **`scripts/activate-ranking.sh`** — selftest/run wrapper (confirm token `ACTIVATE_RANKING`). The
  DB-free selftest asserts: exactly ONE `set_game_config` invocation (→ true on `ranking_enabled`;
  the signature string in the preconditions is counted as existence, not a call site), never another
  window's key, NO direct table DML (seasons only via `ranking_season_open` — both cadence calls
  present, conditional, envelope-asserted), no DDL, no meta-commands, one timed UTC BEGIN..COMMIT,
  the 0145 prosrc pins + cron jobname pin, markers/PASS/rollback-commented, and the
  flag-first/no-auto-roll/mount documentation tokens.

**Verification.** `bash scripts/activate-ranking.sh selftest` green; **mutation-tested 10/10 caught**
(sneaked second flag write, uncommented rollback, dropped weekly season call, gutted conditional
guard, direct table UPDATE, TRUNCATE DDL, psql meta-command, dropped 0145 prosrc pin, retargeted
cron jobname, dropped status-active envelope assert), control green. All 6 existing activate/reveal
selftests untouched-green (trade, captains, exploration, mining, team-command, ember-reach);
`tsc --noEmit` + `vite build` untouched-green (no src change). Docs: plan queue row 9 → script
shipped; ROADMAP phase-17 row annotated. Nothing committed/pushed/applied — the flip stays
human-gated (plan §B rung 5 recommends flipping after rungs 1–3 so ≥3 dimensions accrue).

## 2026-07-12 — ZONES2-1+2 (queue #7+#8): "Ember Reach" content expansion — seeded HIDDEN + the reveal script

**Request.** Queue slices #7+#8 of the full-capacity plan (§C P4, the packet §1.3 Option-C seeds): the
first content expansion — new higher-difficulty hunt zone "Ember Reach", seeded `status='hidden'`, plus
the reveal operation script (reveal IS the cadence mechanism). PURE DATA slice: zero engine edits, zero
flag flips; nothing player-visible until the human runs the reveal.

**Work done**
- **Migration `20260618000175_zones2_ember_reach.sql`** — additive, idempotent (fixed literal UUIDs
  embedding 0175, the 0066 identity idiom; `on conflict (id) do nothing`, any other unique-key collision
  aborts). Seeds: sector **Ashen Frontier** (index 3, danger_tier 3, ACTIVE) + zone **Ember Reach**
  (ACTIVE) + three HIDDEN `pirate_hunt` sites — **Ember Gate** (100,90 · bd 40 · tier 4 · min_power 150),
  **Cinder Maw** (125,110 · bd 50 · tier 4 · 220), **The Furnace** (150,130 · bd 60 · tier 5 · 300).
  Containers are ACTIVE because `get_world_map` filters all THREE levels on `status='active'`
  (0002:121/125/129) and the reveal flips only the location rows; an active zone with zero active
  locations renders nothing (the client flattens locations only — verified). Gates are packet-derived
  [D owner-tunable]: 38 combat_power per kitted+captained ship (§0.3) → 150/220/300 ≈ **4/6/8 ships**
  (≈3/5/6 after the 6-captain bump). Coordinates continue the 0154 distance-orders-by-difficulty ray NE
  beyond Blackden (85.1 → 134.5/166.5/198.5 from home), outside the legacy bbox (x −50…70, y −30…80),
  ≥16%-of-span marker separation (0154's ~9% threshold), deep inside the OSN envelope. Deliberate
  omissions, each justified in the header: no safe waypoint (keeps the reveal exactly-3), no
  anchors/services (not dockable), no location_state seed (worldstate lazily upserts, 0032:37-41);
  `physical_role='activity_site'` (first honest user of the 0065 value; excluded from every port
  predicate). Self-assert DO block: exact 3-row read-back (identity/stats/HIDDEN), monotonic
  gates+distance, game-wide name uniqueness, coordinates in-envelope/outside-bbox, and the
  **hidden-invisibility pin BOTH ways** — structural (`get_world_map` prosrc carries the three
  `status = 'active'` filters) AND behavioral (the migration calls `get_world_map()` — a STABLE
  table-reading SQL function — and asserts none of the 3 names/ids appear).
- **`reward_tier` finding (verified against the TRUE combat head 0169:354):** reward_tier multiplies the
  METAL reward per cleared wave — `round(10 × greatest(tier,1) × (1+0.25×danger))` → tier 4/5 pays
  4×/5× tier-1 metal. ITEM loot (0041 `pirate_loot_for_wave`) keys on WAVE NUMBER only — tier has NO
  loot-table meaning; drops keep riding wave/danger progression as today (defining tier-keyed loot would
  be an engine edit, out of charter). Documented in the migration header.
- **`scripts/reveal-ember-reach.{sql,sh}`** — the reveal operation (activate-family wrapper pattern
  ADAPTED to a reveal; reveal-starter-ports txn semantics). One timed BEGIN..COMMIT, zero psql
  meta-commands. PRECONDITIONS: 0175 recorded by version; the 3 canonical rows exist ALL hidden (a rerun
  fails closed — already-revealed is an error); exact seeded identity (refuses drifted content);
  monotonic gates; parents ACTIVE; `get_world_map` three-level filter prosrc-pinned + a behavioral
  no-leak pre-check. STAGE — **the ONLY write**: ONE `update public.locations set status='active'`
  scoped to the 3 fixed uuids, `row_count=3` asserted. SMOKE: 3 active; net active-locations exactly +3;
  every non-canonical location status-invariant (the offsetting-proof digest); **game_config digest unchanged**
  (a content reveal must never move a flag); behavioral post-check (all 3 names now in the map read).
  Commented manual ROLLBACK: re-hiding IS supported for hunt sites (unlike the port reveal) — sends
  validate status at SEND time only (0019:39/0168:196), settle/combat/return key on location_id, so
  in-flight/in-combat fleets resolve normally and nothing strands; documented in the script. Selftest
  asserts the write-shape inversion (exactly ONE locations UPDATE, zero `set_game_config`, no
  insert/delete/DDL, rollback stays commented) — **mutation-tested: 8/8 mutations caught** (sneaked
  set_game_config, second-table update, uncommented rollback, retargeted uuid, DDL, dropped 0175 gate,
  dropped prosrc pin, sneaked insert), control green.
- **No client change needed**: the galaxy map is data-driven (markerStyle/labelTier derive from the
  location row; useGalaxyMapData flattens whatever get_world_map returns; camera content-fit computes
  its own bbox; grep: nothing keys on location count/sectors — one test fixture uses a synthetic Snare).

**Verification.** New selftest green + mutation-tested (8/8); all existing selftests untouched-green
(activate-team-command/captains/exploration/mining/trade, reveal-starter-ports, team-command-proof,
postreveal-verify); `tsc -b` + `vite build` untouched-green (zero client changes in this slice). The
migration self-asserts at apply time (fail-closed; aborts the deploy on any drift).

**Follow-up (human-gated).** Deploy 0175, then — deliberately later, once teams have kitted up (the
gates assume ≈4/6/8 kitted ships; modules/captains need to be flowing first) — run
`bash scripts/reveal-ember-reach.sh run REVEAL_EMBER_REACH`. Rows 7+8 marked shipped in the plan queue;
ROADMAP phase 23 row added.

## 2026-07-12 — SALVAGE-0/1 (queue #6): the combat-loot → port-economy feed (dark)

**Request.** Queue slice #6 of the full-capacity plan (plan §C P3): ports gain item buy-lists and the
first item→credits path (closes gap G3). One PR = SALVAGE-0 (schema + seed + flag) + SALVAGE-1 (the sell
RPC) + proof; the UI (SALVAGE-2) and the flip (ACT-SALVAGE) are later slices. Everything DARK behind the
new `salvage_market_enabled` flag, seeded `false`.

**Work done**
- **Migration `20260618000174_salvage_market.sql`** —
  `port_item_demand (location_id, item_id, unit_price > 0, active, PK (location_id, item_id))`:
  Reference/Config posture, MIGRATION-SEEDED ONLY, no runtime writer (the `market_offers` 0085/0173
  posture); buy-side only, so no pump loop can exist by construction. Seeded 3 ports × the FIVE items
  that actually drop from combat (grep-verified against `pirate_loot_for_wave` — head 0041, 0171 the
  only re-create): scrap 5/8/6, pirate_alloy 10/16/12, repair_parts 20/12/16, engine_parts 16/14/24,
  weapon_parts 15/13/22 (Haven/Slagworks/Driftmarch — Slagworks the industrial recycler tops
  scrap+alloy, Haven the city tops repair_parts, Driftmarch the frontier tops engine+weapon parts; all
  **[D] owner-tunable**, math in the migration header: a typical 3-wave Snare run = 3 scrap + 1 alloy →
  40 credits at the best port, mid of the 30–80 target; module ingredient baskets sell for ≤168 —
  selling is the floor, crafting the ceiling). Progression items (`captain_memory_shard`,
  `blueprint_fragment`, `artifact_core`) are NEVER sellable — excluded BY OMISSION, pinned by the
  migration self-assert (by id AND by 0039 category) and the proof. `salvage_receipts` = the 0086
  `trade_receipts` idempotency shape point-for-point (unique (main_ship_id, request_id),
  replay-verbatim) as a NEW table — `trade_receipts.good_id` FKs `trade_goods`, structurally
  trade-goods-specific, so item sales cannot reuse it without weakening a live FK.
  **`sell_item_at_port(ship, item, qty numeric, req)`** — the 0090/0138 sell shape on items: SECURITY
  DEFINER + search_path, atomic under the per-ship lock; reject order `not_authenticated` →
  `salvage_market_disabled` (gate FIRST) → `invalid_request`/`invalid_item`/`invalid_quantity`
  (items are INTEGER quantities — fractional rejects, never rounds) → `ship_not_found` → `not_docked`
  (the ONE resolver `mainship_resolve_docked_location`) → `no_demand` → `idempotent_replay` →
  `insufficient_items` (pre-check `inventory_get_balance`; enforcement = `inventory_spend`'s own FOR
  UPDATE — the 0109 crafting posture) → ok: `inventory_spend` + `wallet_credit(qty × unit_price)` +
  receipt, all in-function. ACL: revoke public/anon, grant authenticated. Pipeline law unchanged:
  SALVAGE consumes inventory exactly like crafting; combat never grants credits directly.
- **Proof `scripts/salvage-market-proof.{sql,sh}`** (trade-family — the trade-econ-seed lib-based
  pattern; one BEGIN..ROLLBACK, selftest + local): dark reject with ZERO writes; flag on in-txn only →
  full happy path (players via `commission_first_main_ship`, items via the REAL pipeline leaf
  `public.reward_grant` — never a direct `player_inventory` insert; sell 3 repair_parts at Haven @20 →
  wallet +60 EXACT, inventory 4→1 EXACT, one receipt with exact fields); idempotent replay (no double
  credit/spend/receipt); guards (invalid_quantity 0/−3/2.5, in-transit `not_docked`, crystal
  `no_demand`, over-held `insufficient_items` — all zero-write); the exact 15-row price table pinned by
  full-outer-join; the never-sellable pin (progression absence by id + category, AND a HELD shard still
  → `no_demand`). Wired as the 5th selftest + matrix step of `.github/workflows/trade-v1-proof.yml`;
  `slice-salvage**` added to its branch triggers.
- **Docs**: SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES rows for `port_item_demand` (Reference/Config) + `salvage_receipts`
  (Salvage Market, sole writer `sell_item_at_port`) + the Salvage Market system contract (§E law, same
  PR); FULL_CAPACITY_PLAN queue #6 → shipped (dark); ROADMAP phase row 21 (P3 economy wave).
- **No client code** in this slice; tsc + vite untouched.

## 2026-07-12 — ACT-TRADE (queue #5): the trade-market activation script + the proof chain finally green

**Request.** Queue slice #5 of the full-capacity plan (plan §B rung 3): the human-run flip tool for the
trade market — `scripts/activate-trade.{sql,sh}` in the `activate-team-command` / `activate-captains` /
`activate-exploration` idiom. NO migration in this slice; NO flag flips at merge time — the script is the
recorded human go mechanism, run deliberately later.

**Work done**
- **`scripts/activate-trade.sql`** — one all-or-nothing BEGIN..COMMIT, zero psql meta-commands
  (management-API-runner compatible). PRECONDITIONS (read-only; any failure rolls everything back):
  migration head ≥ `20260618000173` AND 0173 recorded by version (head alone proves nothing — 0171/0172
  are lower numbers); each starter port carries exactly 6 ACTIVE offers over the six 0073 goods (18 rows);
  the anti-pump spread recomputed over every row; the 3 flagship routes re-derived profitable from the
  LIVE rows (ore Slagworks→Haven, provisions Haven→Slagworks, machinery Slagworks→Driftmarch — the
  econ-seed proof's independent-recompute style, cheap form); the DEPLOYED `get_market_offers` /
  `market_buy` / `market_sell` bodies prosrc-pinned to the **0138 re-creates** via two positive tokens —
  `public.mainship_resolve_docked_location(v_ship)` (absent from the 0136 stale bodies, comments included)
  AND `trade_effective_price(` (absent from the pre-drift 0092 bodies) — so the flip physically cannot run
  against a regressed body; relief knobs sane and READ-ONLY (`relief_credits` 250 within
  0 < x ≤ `starting_credits` — relief must never out-pay the wallet seed, the 0095 farming-hole reasoning;
  `relief_max_lifetime_claims` 3 in 1..10; `relief_cooldown_seconds` 86400 ≥ 3600); `starting_credits` and
  `main_ship_price` present (price already 250 on prod runtime since the team activation — never rewritten
  here). STAGE 1 (the ONLY writes): `trade_market_enabled` → true AND `trade_relief_enabled` → true — they
  light TOGETHER (a lit market with dark relief reopens the softlock the floor exists to close). SMOKE
  (read-only): both flags committed (raw + `cfg_bool`); `to_regprocedure` over the 4 client RPCs
  (`get_market_offers(uuid)`, `market_buy(uuid,text,numeric,uuid)`, `market_sell(uuid,text,numeric,uuid)`,
  `market_claim_relief(uuid)`) + the 8 internal leaves (resolve-owned/docked, `trade_effective_price`,
  cargo add/consume, wallet ensure/debit/credit); exactly 18 active offers across exactly 3 ports; the
  anti-pump CHECK constraint pinned by definition text (0085 left it unnamed); `ship_cargo_lots`
  selectable. Markers `ACTIVATE_TRADE_PASS_{PRECONDITIONS,STAGE1,SMOKE}` + a final PASS line naming the
  remaining step. Commented flag-only ROLLBACK (wallets/cargo/receipts/relief claims persist inert; the
  anti-pump constraint makes single-station pumping structurally unprofitable while lit).
- **`scripts/activate-trade.sh`** — selftest/run wrapper (confirm token `ACTIVATE_TRADE`). The DB-free
  selftest pins: exactly 2 `set_game_config` call sites, both → true, exactly the two approved keys; no
  knob rewrite (relief knobs / `starting_credits` / `main_ship_price` / caps), no other-window flag, no
  direct table write, no DDL, no meta-command; one timed txn; rollback stays commented; the 0173 gate,
  the 0138 prosrc pins, the route recomputes, the full smoke list, and the client-PR mount docs all
  present. **Mutation-tested**: flipping a write to `'false'` fails the selftest; injecting a direct
  `update game_config set …` (qualified or not, with or without WHERE) fails the selftest.
- **Client-mount verification (the captains-slice lesson — claim only what mounts).** Repo-verified: the
  one-line client PR flipping `TRADE_MARKET_ENABLED` mounts exactly (a) `MarketPanel` on the Port screen
  main rail (`PortScreen.tsx:61`) — the ONLY newly visible surface — and (b) completes the ShipSwitcher
  OR-gate (`ShipScreen.tsx:62`, `TRADE_MARKET_ENABLED || MAINSHIP_ADDITIONAL_ENABLED`) — the switcher is
  ALREADY mounted because `MAINSHIP_ADDITIONAL_ENABLED` has been true since the 2026-07-12 team launch, so
  it shows no new change. No other consumer of the constant exists (tradeApi/MarketPanel/ShipSwitcher
  reference it in comments only). The panel's wallet/cargo reads are owner-read table reads
  (`player_wallet`, `ship_cargo_lots ⋈ trade_goods`), not RPCs; prices ride `get_market_offers`.
- **Docs:** FULL_CAPACITY_PLAN queue row 5 → script shipped (file brought over from the unmerged
  `docs-full-capacity-plan` branch — this slice carries it if that branch has not merged first);
  ROADMAP phase-10 row annotated.

**Trade-proof-chain archaeology (this branch, earlier this wave).** CI history showed
`trade-v1-proof.yml` had NEVER been green — every historical run failed identically, masked by
path-filtered triggers. Four rot layers, all fixed on this branch before the activation script landed:
1. **Stale 0C fixtures (wallet)** — the TRADE-FLEET-0C proof was authored at chain 0084 (pre-wallet) and
   went stale the day 0091 (ships debit `main_ship_price` 1000) + 0093 (lazy wallet seed 1000) landed:
   the 3rd commissioned ship always died `insufficient_credits`. Fixed by funding the proof wallet
   in-txn (rolled back), citing 0091/0093 — the pricing itself is the designed credit sink.
2. **Cap pin** — 0160 raised `max_main_ships_per_player` 3→24; the proof's cap-enforcement stage was
   about to go latently stale, so the cap is now pinned back to 3 transient-in-txn (the property under
   test is enforcement, not the prod value).
3. **PROP2 non-deterministic ship picker** — all in-proof ships share transaction-frozen `now()` as
   `created_at`, so order-by-created_at asc/desc was plan-dependent and 0160's `group_idx` shifted the
   plan until both picks returned the SAME row; now ordered by `main_ship_id` (unique PK).
4. **Latent `k`-variable ambiguity** — plpgsql variables named `k` collided with the temp tables' `k`
   column (`variable_conflict=error`) in blocks that had never executed because the 0C step always
   failed first; renamed to `sk` (the team-command-proof convention).
After the fixes: all five proof selftests (0C, TM1, bootstrap, econ-seed, team-command) green locally;
the real-chain run happens in CI's disposable Supabase.

**Explicitly NOT in this slice:** running the flip (human-gated, owner-run), the one-line client PR
(`TRADE_MARKET_ENABLED` → true — ships only AFTER a green prod run of the script), any migration, any
knob retune.

**Verification.** `bash scripts/activate-trade.sh selftest` green + both mutation tests fail as designed;
the four trade proof selftests + team-command selftest untouched-green; `npx tsc -b` + `npx vite build`
untouched-green (no client code changed).

## 2026-07-12 — ECON-SEED-1: differentiated three-port economy seed (migration 0173, DARK)

**Request.** Queue slice #4 of the full-capacity plan: seed the owner-approved multiport price table
(master plan §C P1) so the trade-market activation (ACT-TRADE, queue #5) lights a real
buy-low/travel/sell-high economy instead of the single-port Haven placeholder. Zero live impact —
trade stays dark (`trade_market_enabled=false`); no flag flip, no client change, no activation script.

**Work done**
- **Migration `20260618000173_econ_seed_multiport_offers.sql`** (numbered 0173 to stay clear of
  in-flight 0171/0172; depends only on 0066 ports + 0073 goods + 0085 `market_offers`): idempotent
  upsert (`on conflict (location_id, good_id) do update`) of all 18 rows — 3 starter ports × 6 goods.
  Port roles: **Haven** (city/consumer — pays well for ore 16 + provisions 12), **Slagworks**
  (industrial — sells ore cheapest at 12, pays for provisions 19 + machinery 70 inputs),
  **Driftmarch** (frontier — pays premiums, top machinery payer at 120, sells everything dear).
  Haven reconciliation: the 0085 placeholder prices ALREADY equal the approved table — zero deltas;
  the `do update` arm just guarantees convergence on re-apply.
- **Self-assert DO block** in the migration: each port carries exactly 6 active offers; the anti-pump
  spread (`sell_price >= buy_price`) holds on every seeded row; 3 CONCRETE profitable routes
  recomputed from the rows (direction law: player buys at origin `sell_price`, sells at destination
  `buy_price` → profit = dest.buy − origin.sell): ore Slagworks 12 → Haven 16 (+4), provisions
  Haven 15 → Slagworks 19 (+4), machinery Slagworks 88 → Driftmarch 120 (+32).
- **Proof `scripts/trade-econ-seed-proof.{sql,sh}`** (sources `scripts/lib/trade-proof-lib.sh`;
  read-only over Reference/Config, still begin→ROLLBACK per the trade idiom; toggles NO flag):
  `ES1_PASS_MULTIPORT` (all 18 rows active at exactly the approved prices, matched against an inline
  expected table), `ES1_PASS_ROUTES` (the 3 route profits recomputed from the seeded rows — never
  hardcode-trusted — and pinned to +4/+4/+32), `ES1_PASS_ANTIPUMP` (every row), `ES1_PASS_ROLES`
  (Slagworks is the cheapest ore seller; Driftmarch pays the most for machinery). Wired into
  `.github/workflows/trade-v1-proof.yml` (selftest step + a fourth real-chain matrix step;
  `slice-econ-**` added to the push triggers).
- **Docs:** ROADMAP trade row annotated (seed shipped, awaiting the ACT-TRADE flip).

**Explicitly NOT in this slice** (ACT-TRADE, queue #5): flipping `trade_market_enabled` /
`trade_relief_enabled` / client `TRADE_MARKET_ENABLED`, and any activation script.

**Verification.** `bash scripts/trade-econ-seed-proof.sh selftest` green; all pre-existing trade +
team-command proof selftests untouched-green; `npx tsc -b` + `npx vite build` untouched-green.
Real-chain run happens in CI's disposable Supabase (no Docker on this machine).

## 2026-07-12 — ACTIVATION PREP: exploration + mining flip scripts + the 0172 writer reconcile (Phases 11/12; no flip)

**Request.** Full-capacity plan queue slices #2+#3: ship the two HUMAN-run activation scripts for the
fully-built-dark exploration (0097–0101 + 0146 dup-guard) and mining (0102–0106 + 0143 double-extract
guard) systems, in the proven `activate-team-command` / `activate-captains` idiom. The adversarial
review of the slice then UPGRADED a "noted in passing" finding to a launch-blocker and found its twin
(both the same failure class), so the slice grew ONE fix migration. NO flag flipped by this slice —
each script run is a later, deliberate human go decision.

**Bugs found (both pre-existing; both the SAME mistake — a "verbatim" re-create copied a STALE body)**
- **H1 (HIGH — launch-blocker for the exploration flip).** 0146's re-create of `exploration_scan`
  copied the 0099 body, silently reverting 0100's insert change: new discoveries recorded NO
  `main_ship_id`. The securing fallback `mainship_resolve_owned_ship(player, null)` resolves ONLY
  when the player owns EXACTLY one ship (0081:47-51) and returns null otherwise, making
  `process_exploration_securing` `continue` (0100:223-228) — FOREVER. Multi-ship commissioning is
  LIVE since the team flip, so the day exploration flipped, any 2+-ship player's discovery rewards
  would have stranded permanently. (Initially logged here as "functionally safe" — WRONG: the
  fallback is not a safety net for multi-ship owners, it is a dead end.)
- **H2 (HIGH — same class).** 0143's re-create of `mining_extract` copied the 0104 body, clobbering
  0137's P19 field-depletion integration (the reserve-scaled bundle at step 11.5 + the
  `worldstate_deplete_field` call at step 12.5): the deployed writer had ZERO depletion hooks and
  `worldstate_deplete_field` had NO caller. Latent while `world_balance_enabled=false`, but it would
  have silently killed the P19 depletion subsystem the day world balance lights.
- **Systemic lesson (recorded in the 0172 header too):** a CREATE OR REPLACE re-create must start
  from the TRUE head body — grep ALL later migrations for the function name before copying. The
  parity-re-create law exists for exactly this; both regressions came from copying a stale body.

**Work done**
- **Migration `20260618000172_exploration_mining_writer_reconcile.sql`** — re-creates BOTH writers
  from their true current heads with the dropped features merged back (diff-verified, code-only):
  `exploration_scan` = the 0146 head body + ONE marked hunk (the discoveries insert records
  `main_ship_id` again — the exact 0100:170 column set; the 0146 `unique_violation` handler KEPT
  verbatim); `mining_extract` = the 0143 head body (advisory lock KEPT) + the 0137 hunks re-merged
  verbatim (depletion locals, step 11.5 reserve scaling, `v_bundle` in the insert + result envelope,
  step 12.5 deplete call). Both writers are dark (flags false) so the re-creates are not live-risky;
  ACLs re-asserted per precedent. The header documents the PROSRC-ASSERT COUPLING: the activation
  scripts require the literal tokens `unique_violation` + `pending_bundle_json, main_ship_id`
  (exploration) and `pg_advisory_xact_lock` + `worldstate_deplete_field` (mining) in the deployed
  bodies — future re-creates must keep them (the in-body comments deliberately avoid the exact
  tokens so a comment can never satisfy the assert).
- `scripts/activate-exploration.{sql,sh}` — one all-or-nothing BEGIN..COMMIT, zero psql meta-commands
  (management-API/Dashboard-paste compatible). PRECONDITIONS: head ≥ **0172** + 0172 recorded (the H1
  fix is a HARD gate); the 5 seeded sites present+active; every active bundle catalog-closed against
  `item_types`; the MERGED writer LIVE (the 0098 `exploration_discoveries_player_id_site_id_key`
  unique constraint by name + prosrc of the deployed `exploration_scan` containing BOTH the 0146
  `unique_violation` handler AND the 0172-restored `pending_bundle_json, main_ship_id` insert column
  list — the flip physically cannot run against the broken writer); keys exist; the
  `exploration_scan_radius` knob asserted sane (0 < r ≤ 20000) and NEVER rewritten. STAGE 1: the ONE
  write — `exploration_enabled` → true via `set_game_config`. SMOKE (read-only): committed flag (raw +
  `cfg_bool`); `to_regprocedure` over the whole surface (`command_exploration_scan(uuid, uuid)`,
  `get_my_exploration_discoveries()`, `exploration_scan(uuid, uuid, uuid)`,
  `process_exploration_securing()`, `osn_distance(dp×4)`, `reward_grant(text, uuid, uuid, uuid,
  jsonb)`); ≥ 5 active sites; EXACTLY ONE `process-exploration-securing` cron job.
  `ACTIVATE_EXPLORATION_PASS_*` markers + final PASS line; flag-only commented ROLLBACK (packet §7:
  discoveries persist harmlessly; the 0100 processor ignores the flag and — because the flip
  preconditions on 0172 — every post-flip discovery records its ship, so securing never depends on
  the multi-ship-ambiguous resolver fallback; rows can still legitimately wait for a safe settle or
  an active home base).
- `scripts/activate-mining.{sql,sh}` — same shape: head ≥ **0172** + 0172 recorded (the H2 fix is a
  HARD gate); 5 fields seeded+active; bundles catalog-closed; the MERGED writer LIVE (prosrc of the
  deployed `mining_extract` containing BOTH `pg_advisory_xact_lock` AND `worldstate_deplete_field`) +
  the 0103 `mining_extractions_cooldown_idx`; `mining_extract_radius` /
  `mining_extract_cooldown_seconds` asserted sane, never rewritten → `mining_enabled` → true → smoke
  (`command_mining_extract(uuid, uuid)`, `get_my_mining_extractions()`, `mining_extract(uuid, uuid,
  uuid)`, `process_mining_securing()`, the shared leaves, plus `worldstate_field_remaining(uuid)` /
  `worldstate_deplete_field(uuid)`; ONE `process-mining-securing` cron). The 0137 hooks stay dormant
  behind `world_balance_enabled=false` — the script never touches that flag.
  `ACTIVATE_MINING_PASS_*` markers; flag-only ROLLBACK + the documented (not asserted) POST-FLIP WATCH:
  `mining_extractions` rows with `secured_at` NULL are pending yields securing on the next safe settle.
- **NO client PR needed for either flip (verified this slice):** ExplorationPanel/MiningPanel are
  server-lit — `if (!isServerLit(result)) return null` (ExplorationPanel.tsx:70 on
  `get_my_exploration_discoveries`; MiningPanel.tsx:77 on `get_my_mining_extractions`) — and both are
  already mounted unconditionally on MapScreen's top-left OverlayRail (MapScreen.tsx:141/148); no
  exploration/mining compile constant exists in `osnReleaseGates.ts`. The server flip alone mounts both.
- **Run order (documented in both headers):** exploration first (packet §7 "can go first"), mining a
  few days later; the scripts are fully independent (neither touches the other's key — selftest-enforced).
- **Proof coverage note:** no disposable SQL proof pins these two writer bodies today
  (`team-command-proof` covers combat; `verify-exploration.mjs`/`verify-mining.mjs` probe dark-reject
  envelopes + function existence, not bodies; `mining-p12-double-extract-concurrency.sh` pins the
  0143 advisory-lock behavior, which 0172 keeps, so it stays valid). The activation preconditions now
  BIND both fixes via the prosrc asserts — the flips cannot run against a regressed writer. A lit-path
  depletion proof remains deferred to the P19/world-balance activation checklist (0137's own note).
- Docs: ROADMAP Phase 11/12 rows annotated "activation script shipped — awaiting human flip".

**Verification.** Both `.sh` selftests green (DB-free static safety: exactly 1 `set_game_config` call
site on the 1 approved key, no meta-commands, no knob/foreign-key writes, no DDL/table writes —
including unqualified `UPDATE … SET` (the write-net regex covers `update (public.)?<table> set`, not
just `update public.`), rollback commented, markers + prosrc-bindings + no-client-PR + run-order
documented; mutation-tested — a `false` write, a removed H1/H2 prosrc assert, and an injected
unqualified `update … set` are each caught). 0172's re-created bodies diff-verified code-only against
their heads: exploration_scan vs 0146 = ONLY the 2-line insert (adds `main_ship_id`/`p_main_ship_id`);
mining_extract vs 0143 = ONLY the 0137 hunks (4 locals, step 11.5, `v_bundle` swap ×2, step 12.5);
mining_extract vs 0137 = ONLY the 0143 step-10b advisory lock. `npx tsc -b` + `npx vite build`
untouched-green; `scripts/team-command-proof.sh selftest` still green.

**Open follow-ups**
- Deploy 0172 (with the normal migration pipeline) BEFORE the exploration flip — the activation
  script hard-fails without it, by design.
- The flips themselves are HUMAN-gated: `bash scripts/activate-exploration.sh run ACTIVATE_EXPLORATION`
  (then `node scripts/verify-exploration.mjs` + the packet §7 manual smoke), and days later
  `bash scripts/activate-mining.sh run ACTIVATE_MINING` (then `node scripts/verify-mining.mjs`).

## 2026-07-12 — DEPLOYS: prod migration head 0169; team-command roadmap merged (main @ 9a292ed)

**Merged.** The whole team-command roadmap (A → D4) + the Mission Control UI renewal (R0 → R4) are on
`main` @ `9a292ed` (stacked slice branches landed via PRs #86/#87 and #97). **Zero open PRs.**

**Deployed.** GitHub Pages auto-deploy live (players see the Mission Control UI). Migrations: the owner
approved the pending production deployments — `0165` (C0), then `0166–0169` (D0–D3) — **prod head =
`20260618000169`**. Everything team-shaped stays DARK: `team_command_enabled=false` (server, reject-before-read
on every team RPC) + `TEAM_COMMAND_ENABLED=false` (compile-time; TeamRosterPanel not mounted). No flag flipped.

**Next.** Activation is human-gated, never a slice: `docs/TEAM_COMMAND.md` "ACTIVATION CHECKLIST" — decision
support in the new `docs/TEAM_ACTIVATION_PACKET.md`.

---

## 2026-07-12 — TEAM-COMMAND Slice D complete (D0–D4): team combat, dark (migrations 0166–0169)

One line per sub-slice (full detail: `docs/TEAM_COMMAND.md`):
- **D0 (0166, RPC-only).** `calculate_group_expedition_stats` — service_role-only team-stats authority:
  per-member delegation to the *unmodified* `calculate_expedition_stats`, team-level folding ONLY (the eight
  additive 0122 keys summed, `speed = min`; STRICT refuse-don't-clamp — any member raise refuses the team) +
  the thin gated wrapper `get_my_group_expedition_totals` (any raise → one opaque `stats_invalid`).
- **D1 (0167, schema + parity re-creates).** `combat_units` widened to carry a member main ship
  (`main_ship_id` XOR `unit_type_id`, frozen attack/defense snapshots); the LIVE `process_combat_ticks`
  (head 0046) + `report_create` (head 0026) re-created with provably-inert deltas only (coalesce-first reads
  / member-row-gated branches — member rows have NO writer until D2). Three new internal leaves:
  `combat_fleet_return_speed`, `mainship_sync_combat_hp`, `mainship_mark_combat_destroyed`.
- **D2 (0168).** The team enters the engine: `send_ship_group_hunt` (ONE fleet per team over the 0050
  narrow bridge; power = Σ member `combat_power`, speed = min — the D0 folding law), the
  `group_sortie_members` manifest (manifest-wins routing law), and `combat_create_group_encounter` — the
  FIRST member-row writer (raise-free by construction: a bad member degrades to an inert `alive_count=0`
  row), routed by a single manifest-gated branch in the re-created `combat_create_encounter` (head 0023).
- **D3 (0169).** Sortie settle: the escape/forced-extract branch marks surviving members `'returning'`
  via the ONE 0152 leaf; the 0050 reconciler re-homes members once their manifest fleet finishes (exact-
  complement race guard); manifests RETAINED (die with their fleet via the 0047 retention cascade); retreat
  verified verbatim; **the M1 activation blocker FIXED** (the live single send now re-claims the ship row
  under `FOR UPDATE` re-verifying `status='home'` — a lost `'hunting'→'traveling'` update now rejects).
- **D4 (frontend-only).** The dark Hunt UI (hunt-zone select + two-click confirm in TeamRosterPanel),
  the authoritative "Server totals" beside the C1 estimate, and combat-panel member-unit null-safety
  (`combatUnitLabel`: uuid-shaped key → "Team ship xxxxxxxx"). **Roadmap A → D4 COMPLETE, fully dark.**

**Proof.** `scripts/team-command-proof.{sql,sh}` (disposable write-then-ROLLBACK, CI workflow) gained the
TEAMSTATS / COMBATPARITY / TEAMHUNT / TEAMSETTLE blocks — incl. the delegation pin (totals == the proof's own
independent per-member sums), the tick parity pin (`player_damage` == Σ attack), the manifest-wins pin
(mid-flight unassign leaves the sortie intact), and the M1 race pin.

## 2026-07-12 — UI RENEWAL R0–R4: Mission Control (PRs #86, #87–#91; frontend-only)

The full visual renewal, shipped in five slices with no migration and no behavior change:
- **R0** — Mission Control design-system foundation (tokens + primitives).
- **R1** — Mission Control galaxy map (marker hierarchy, starfield, overlay slots).
- **R2** — legacy panels converted to the Mission Control tokens + primitives (panel skins).
- **R3** — screen composition: the Ship / Port / Command two-rail split.
- **R4** — first-run, loading, and combat polish (Mission Control complete).

**Verification:** `tsc -b` + `vite build` green per slice; pure-logic specs green; dark surfaces byte-identical.

---

## 2026-07-12 — TEAM-COMMAND Slices C0 + C1: captains into teams, dark (migration 0165)

- **C0 (0165, RPC-only, ZERO data change).** `get_my_group_expedition_preview(p_group_id, p_activity)` —
  dark read-only group preview; per member it calls the *unmodified* `calculate_expedition_stats` in a
  per-member exception scope (`valid:false` + error, never a team 500); zero stat arithmetic in SQL. **Both**
  captain-slot bumps (hull `base_captain_slots` 2→6 AND the instance backfill) are DEFERRED TO ACTIVATION —
  the Ship screen renders both values ungated, so either bump would be player-visible while dark.
- **C1 (frontend-only).** Captain roster inside the team roster: per-member assign/unassign via the existing
  CAPTAIN-P15 commands verbatim (no new server authority), rendered only while
  `isServerLit(get_my_captain_instances)`; plus the per-team expedition-preview UI (`aggregateTeamStats` —
  display-only estimate; the authority is D0's).

**Proof:** the team-command proof gained TEAMCMD_PASS_CAPTAINS (captain seed-bonus delta over an uncaptained
baseline, uncaptained byte-parity with the solo preview, unassign-reverts; captains provisioned only via the
sole writers).

---

## 2026-07-11 — TEAM-COMMAND Slice B complete: send/stop BY TEAM, dark (migrations 0161–0164 + UI + proof)

- **B0 (0161).** The dark group write path: `upsert_ship_group` / `assign_ship_to_group` +
  `mainship_resolve_owned_group` (explicit-only; dual same-`auth.uid()` resolution closes the same-player gap).
- **B1 (0162).** `delete_ship_group` (lock + revalidate; members un-grouped by the 0160 `ON DELETE SET NULL`)
  + the interactive (still dark) roster UI: create/rename/delete/assign, no optimistic UI.
- **B-send (0163).** `send_ship_group_expedition` — loops the *unmodified* live send once per member inside
  ONE all-or-nothing subtransaction; writes no movement row directly (no second movement engine).
- **B-stop (0164).** `stop_ship_group_transit` — best-effort twin (per-member subtransactions; skip is
  legitimate): halt every haltable via the unmodified live STOP=HOLD, aggregate `{stopped, skipped, failed}`.
- **B-ui.** Send (destination select) + Stop controls in the roster, behind the compile-time gate.
- **B-verify (PR #84).** The disposable write-then-ROLLBACK proof `scripts/team-command-proof.{sql,sh}` +
  `.github/workflows/team-command-proof.yml` (a `.sql`/`.sh` proof, not the once-planned `.mjs`).

## 2026-07-09 — A0 FOUNDATION FIXUP + TEAM-COMMAND Slice A: team model (migrations 0159, 0160)

- **A0 (PR #77, 0159).** The pre-team audit blockers closed: `get_my_docked_store` (0158) +
  `get_my_expedition_preview` (0049) converted from unguarded arbitrary-ship reads to the
  `mainship_resolve_owned_ship` pattern (trailing `p_main_ship_id`); the 3 client `.maybeSingle()` ship reads
  made plural + selection-aware; ship selection lifted into ONE `shellState.selection` (was 3 disagreeing
  instances).
- **Slice A (PR #78, 0160).** `ship_groups` (one row per `(player_id, group_index 1..3)`, owner-select RLS,
  created empty) + `main_ship_instances.group_id`; `max_main_ships_per_player` raised 3 → 24 (inert while
  commissioning stays gated); `team_command_enabled` seeded `false`; dead `get_main_ship` (0043) dropped —
  the last arbitrary-ship reader. Read-only TeamRosterPanel behind `TEAM_COMMAND_ENABLED = false`.

## 2026-07-09 — PR #75 merged: recall/return-home removed + stop-zoom fix; session handoff (#76)

**#75 `fix-remove-recall`.** Recall/return-home removed end to end (port-centric: there is no home base to
return to), the (0,0) "home" ship marker suppressed, full spaghetti cleanup + unit-test fixes, and the
stop-zoom camera fix (single focus point → gentle neighbourhood zoom, not MAX_K). 214 pure-logic specs pass.
**#76** — the session HANDOFF doc (machine setup, live state, team roadmap).

---

## 2026-07-08 — PORT-CENTRIC ACTIVATED on prod + station storage (migrations 0157/0158)

**Activation (human-gated flag flips, per `docs/PORTCENTRIC_DECISION_PACKET.md`).** The game is now
port-centric on the LIVE prod DB: `mainship_space_movement_enabled=true` (OSN port-to-port travel + docking),
3 starter ports REVEALED (Haven / Slagworks / Driftmarch — reveal is one-way), and
`station_storage_enabled=true`. Utility: `scripts/activate-port-centric.mjs --confirm`; rollback = flags only
(reveal persists).

**Station storage (PR #73, 0157/0158).** Per-port, per-player storage — the docked-port "Hangar": P1
foundation (tables + sole writer) + P2 docked store/read surface (`get_my_docked_store`).

**Port-centric UI (PR #74).** The home base removed from the app; map readability fixes (#72 wheel-zoom no
longer scrolls the page; bigger location dots/labels).

---

## 2026-07-07 — STOP = HOLD, Slice D2: client copy/comments now match the hold semantics

**Request.** Replace the now-false "return home" wording in the visible Stop UI (and the stale in-code
comments) so the client matches the server hold behavior — the last frontend piece of the goal.

**Change (frontend copy + comments only — no logic).** Legacy Stop CTA (`MapScreen.tsx`):
`stopLabel` "Stop — return home" → "Stop — hold here"; `stoppedMessage` "Turning around — returning home."
→ "Holding position in open space."; its block comment rewritten from "0149: halt → symmetric return home"
to "0155: halt an in-transit legacy move and HOLD the ship in open space; re-depart to a new leg from the
held position via MainShipCommand". Comment/doc sync in the stop wrappers: `spaceStopCommand.ts`
(`STOP_TRANSIT_RPC` header → hold; `parseStopTransitResult` no-op list `already_returning` → `already_held`,
the 0155 reason rename — the `{stopped:false}→'arrived'` mapping is unchanged and still correct),
`mainshipApi.ts` (`commandMainShipStopTransit` 0149 → 0155, "symmetric return time" → "holds the ship in open
space", reason example → `already_held`), `SpaceStopControls.tsx` (header example → "Stop — hold here"),
`useSpaceStopCommand.ts` (0149 → 0155, hold semantics, and corrected the stale "each legacy trip is a fresh
fleet" note — hold/resume reuses the SAME fleet, and the per-leg reset comes from the CTA's outbound-only
mount dropping the fleet id to null and back). The held-send success copy in `MainShipCommand.tsx` was
already the refined "Main ship departing to …" from Slice D1 (matches the siblings moving/dispatched) — no
change needed.

**Deliberately UNCHANGED (out of scope):** the OSN stop copy defaults, the stop-controller logic, and the
still-valid **recall** feature (`request_main_ship_return`, the Ship screen's "Return home" button) — recall
genuinely returns a present ship home and is not the removed stop-return-home.

The server before/after (why return-home was removed) is in the Slice A (0155) / Slice B (0156) entries — not
duplicated here. With D2 the Stop=HOLD goal is implementation-complete on this branch (server 0155/0156 +
verifier + frontend wiring D1 + copy D2), PR-ready for human merge review.

**Verification (this sandbox, honest).** `npm run build` → green. `npm run lint` → the pre-existing 22-error
baseline, zero new on touched files. `grep -rniE 'return home|returning home|symmetric return'` over `src/`
shows NO remaining Stop wording (only the unrelated recall button/screen, correctly left).

## 2026-07-06 — STOP = HOLD, Slice C: verifier proves the legacy hold round-trip

**Request.** Make `scripts/verify-stop-roundtrip.mjs` prove the NEW legacy Stop=HOLD contract (Slices A/B),
replacing its stale legacy section which still asserted the removed return-home behavior.

**Change (verifier only — no migration, no client runtime).** Rewrote the LEGACY family (L1–L10) to prove
**send → stop(HELD) → send-from-held → stop(HELD)**: leg 1 departs present; **stop 1** halts and holds
(`{stopped:true, held:true}` + halt coords; leg-1 `fleet_movements` row → terminal `'cancelled'`; ship
`stationary`/`in_space` at its own coordinates; fleet `completed` with `active_movement_id` cleared); a
**duplicate stop** is an idempotent `{stopped:false, reason:'already_held'}` no-op with no drift; **leg 2
RESUMES** from the held point via `move_main_ship_to_location` on the SAME fleet (new movement,
`origin_type='space'`); **stop 2** holds the resumed leg again. Also fixed the OSN re-dock bridge: the ship
now ends HELD (not home) after the legacy family, so the anchored OSN origin is re-established by sending the
HELD ship to a dockable port via the one legacy held-departure path (was `send_main_ship_expedition`, which
requires `home`). New helpers: `active_movement_id` added to the fleet read, `origin_type` to the movement
read, and `isLegacyHeldFleet`; removed the now-unused `pollShipHome` (a held ship never goes home).

**The OSN family (O1–O10) and the consumed-key regression probe are UNCHANGED** — they already prove the OSN
true-hold + the receipt-replay pin, and stay valid.

**Assertion-shape note (honest):** the 0155 hold envelope carries `{ok, stopped, held, main_ship_id, space_x,
space_y}` — deliberately NO `movement_id` (Slice A spec). So the stop assertions check those fields, and
per-leg identity is proven the stronger way — the specific `mvL1`/`mvL2` `fleet_movements` row going
`'cancelled'` in the DB — rather than a self-reported envelope id. No migration was changed for this (Slice C
is verifier + re-dock only).

The before/after Stop semantics and why return-home was removed are recorded in the Slice A (0155) and Slice
B (0156) entries below — not duplicated here.

**Verification (this sandbox, honest).** `node --check scripts/verify-stop-roundtrip.mjs` → OK.
`npm run build` → green (no `src/` touched). The end-to-end DB run **defers here by design** (needs
`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` + egress — the 0148–0154 precedent; the script exits 2 without the key). It runs
at the human apply gate.

## 2026-07-06 — STOP = HOLD, Slice B: RESUME from the held point (migration 0156)

**Request.** Complete the Stop-hold fix: Slice A (0155) made Stop park the ship in open space, but nothing
could then Send it onward — recon confirmed no legacy Send accepts a `spatial_state='in_space'` fleet
(`send_main_ship_expedition` needs ship `status='home'`; `move_main_ship_to_location` /
`request_main_ship_return` need fleet `status='present'` + active presence). This slice adds the resume.

**Design decision (self-approved): ONE send path, not a parallel resume RPC.** Extend
`move_main_ship_to_location` to depart from EITHER validated departure state — "present at a location" OR the
new "held in open space" — deriving the movement ORIGIN accordingly. "Depart from a held point" is just a
different origin for the same location-target `rally` movement, so the one RPC keeps ONE movement path and
reuses its destination-validation / speed / `movement_create` / in-flight-marking machinery.

**Change (Slice B — migration `20260618000156_mainship_legacy_depart_from_hold.sql`):**
1. **`fleet_movements.origin_type` domain extended** (forward-only, additive): drop + re-add the inline
   column CHECK → `origin_type in ('base','location','zone','space')`. A `'space'` origin = departed from a
   held open-space coordinate with NO base/location/zone anchor (`origin_*_id` all NULL, `origin_x/y` = the
   held coordinates). **Safe because `origin_type` is provenance metadata only** — settlement branches solely
   on `target_type` (`process_fleet_movements` 0030:53,60,74; `movement_settle_arrival` 0151/0153); nothing
   anywhere reads `origin_type` to decide (verified across migrations + `src/`). Same table, same sole writer
   (Movement), same `target_type`-driven arrival — **not** the OSN coordinate domain (`main_ship_space_movements`
   untouched).
2. **`move_main_ship_to_location` generalized** (0152 body): present-departure path preserved; a **held-departure
   branch** is selected when the fleet is not present — it requires the exact 0155 held shape
   (`main_ship_instances` status='stationary', spatial_state='in_space', space_x/y NOT NULL) and departs from
   those raw coordinates (`origin_type='space'`, no presence to close). Destination validation (active,
   `activity_type='none'`, non-combat) + speed + `movement_create` + the in-flight mark are **shared** — the
   ONLY per-branch difference is how the origin is derived (and `presence_complete` on the present branch).
   The fleet flip to `moving` is ONE shared guarded UPDATE (present: `status='present'`; hold:
   `status='completed'`; both `active_movement_id IS NULL`), raise+rollback on miss (0053 discipline). The
   ship is marked in-flight via the **same 0152 helper** the present branch already uses
   (`mainship_mark_legacy_in_flight(ship,'traveling')`) — no inline duplication; for a held departure that
   same write clears the held coordinates as the ship leaves the hold point.

**Accepted micro-deltas on the present path (documented; observable behavior preserved — 0153 precedent):**
the shared fleet-flip guard adds a NO-OP `active_movement_id IS NULL` for present and generalizes the
race-only raise message; `presence_complete` now runs just after `movement_create` (independent tables, same
atomic txn); the success envelope gains an additive `from` marker ('present' | 'hold') with existing keys
unchanged (`from_location_id` NULL for a held departure).

**No flag flip, no OSN touch, no new table, no new RPC, no `send_main_ship_expedition` change.** Movement
stays sole writer of `fleet_movements`; Main Ship sole writer of `main_ship_instances`; non-combat
destinations only. **Slice C** updates the client (find/select the held fleet + the `from` marker) and
rewrites the stop-roundtrip verifier's legacy section to send→stop(held)→send→stop(held).

**Verification (this sandbox, honest).** `npm run build` → green. No JS touched (`node --check` n/a).
`docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` synced same step (origin_type domain + `move_main_ship_to_location` departs
present OR held). DB-dependent verifiers defer here by design (no service-role key + blocked egress — the
0148–0154 precedent); the send→stop(held)→send→stop(held) run is Slice C's rewritten verifier at the human
apply gate.

## 2026-07-06 — STOP = HOLD-IN-OPEN-SPACE (legacy), Slice A: stop settlement (migration 0155)

**Request.** "Stop must HOLD, not return home." The visible Stop button drove
`command_main_ship_stop_transit`, whose head-of-branch body (0149, re-created verbatim in 0152) HALTED an
outbound legacy main-ship transit and then flew the ship **all the way back to its origin base** — it
transformed the moving `fleet_movements` row in place into the `return_home` shape (symmetric turnaround),
stepped the fleet moving→returning, and set the ship 'returning'. That is the wrong semantic: the player
asked to stop *where they are*, not to abandon the trip and travel the whole way home. (The prior 2026-07-06
"stop fix" was a client-only idempotency-key fix — orthogonal; return-home was still live.)

**Change (Slice A — migration `20260618000155_mainship_legacy_stop_holds_in_space.sql`).** Re-create
`command_main_ship_stop_transit` with everything up to the halt-point interpolation UNCHANGED (auth · the
EXISTING `mainship_send_enabled` gate, unchanged · owned-main-ship-fleet checks · claim the `status='moving'`
`fleet_movements` row FOR UPDATE in the cron's lock order · the `arrived` due-row no-op that leaves settlement
to the cron · the `v_frac`/`v_turn_x`/`v_turn_y` math). Only the **settlement** changes, to a true HOLD:
- **`fleet_movements` row →** `status='cancelled', resolved_at=now()` (a first-class terminal in the 0007
  status domain `moving|arrived|cancelled|failed`). 'cancelled' is the honest terminal for a player halt —
  the ship did NOT reach `target_x/target_y` (so not `'arrived'`), and it is not an error (`'failed'`). Once
  non-'moving', the cron's `status='moving'` scan skips it forever; no arrival, no base/location deposit
  (main-ship legacy targets carry no reward — 0149:35-37).
- **`fleets` row →** `status='completed', location_mode='movement', active_movement_id=NULL, current_*=NULL`
  — the movement-less settled terminal, guarded `where status='moving' and active_movement_id=m.id` (raise +
  roll back on miss, 0149's discipline). This is the EXACT shape the OSN stop leaves a fleet held in open
  space (0064:312-317); it mirrors a normal legacy settlement (`fleet_complete`→'completed') but points at
  no base/location because the ship stopped out in space.
- **`main_ship_instances` row →** the held-in-open-space shape `status='stationary', spatial_state='in_space',
  space_x=v_turn_x, space_y=v_turn_y` (was `status='returning'`). **This reuses the EXISTING legal
  `(stationary, in_space)` representation** — legal under the 0055 lifecycle CHECKs (in_space⇒stationary
  0055:143-144; stationary⇒in_space|at_location 0055:159-161) + the 0054 coordinate rule (in_space REQUIRES
  both finite coordinates). It is the SAME canonical shape OSN's stop writes (0064:319-322). Written inline
  to match 0149/0152's established style; the shared invariant is the constraint set (single source of truth
  for what "held in open space" legally is), not a helper — each domain settles its OWN movement inline.

**Idempotency / replay.** A stop grants nothing → no receipt. The old `already_returning` no-op is gone
(Stop no longer produces a `return_home` row): a duplicate Stop now finds no moving row and, since the ship
is already `(stationary, in_space)`, returns `{ok:true, stopped:false, reason:'already_held'}`;
`already_settled` (no moving row, not held) and `arrived` (due row left for the cron) are unchanged.

**Response shape changed:** a successful hold returns `{ok:true, stopped:true, held:true, main_ship_id,
space_x, space_y}` — NO `arrive_at` (the ship is parked, not arriving). **Slice C** updates the client copy /
handling to this shape.

**No constraint edit, no new table, no flag change, OSN untouched.** Movement stays sole writer of
`fleet_movements`; Main Ship stays sole writer of `main_ship_instances`; the OSN coordinate domain and its
`mainship_space_movement_enabled` flag are not touched; `mainship_send_enabled` is unchanged. **Slice B**
(next) adds legacy **re-departure (Send) from the held position** — recon confirmed no existing legacy Send
can resume from a `spatial_state='in_space'` fleet (`send_main_ship_expedition` needs `status='home'`;
`move_main_ship_to_location`/`request_main_ship_return` need `status='present'` + active presence).

**Verification (this sandbox, honest).** `npm run build` → green. `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` synced in the
same step (Movement matrix cell + the `command_main_ship_stop_transit` flow section rewritten from
return-home → hold-in-open-space; the 0152 helper-callers blockquote corrected — Stop is no longer a
`mainship_mark_legacy_in_flight` caller; ownership rows unchanged). No JS touched (`node --check` n/a).
DB-dependent verifiers defer here by design (no service-role key + blocked egress — the 0148–0154 precedent).

**Known stale test, retired in Slice B (flagged, not fake-fixed):** `scripts/verify-stop-roundtrip.mjs`'s
LEGACY section (L3/L4/L9/L10) still asserts the OLD return-home shape (`mission_type='return_home'`, ship
`returning`/`spatial_state` NULL) and its leg-2 re-departure relies on the ship settling HOME between trips —
a path 0155 removes. It is NOT rewritten here: the correct legacy assertions are the held-in-space +
re-departure pattern the verifier's OSN section already uses (O4/O5/O10), and leg-2 re-departure only becomes
reachable once Slice B adds legacy Send-from-held. Slice B rewrites the legacy section to
send→stop(**held**)→send→stop(**held**) and it runs at the human apply gate. (Retirement condition:
Slice B lands the resume path + the rewritten verifier.)

## 2026-07-06 — GOAL WRAP-UP: stop fix + UI rebuild + map declutter — final verification & the ONE apply-time checklist

**Scope of the goal (all three items implementation-complete on this branch; docs-only final pass):**
(1) the Stop bug, (2) the full UI rebuild, (3) the map declutter. Whole-branch verification ran
clean — no remnant found, nothing fixed in this slice.

**Final verification results (honest; this sandbox):**
- `npm run build` → green. `npm run lint` → exactly the 22 pre-existing errors (all in files this
  goal never touched; ZERO on any goal surface). `node --check scripts/verify-stop-roundtrip.mjs`
  → OK. Controller unit specs (`spaceStopCommand` / `portMoveCommand` / `spaceMoveCommand`) →
  **40/40 green** (includes the consumed-key regression cases).
- DB-dependent verifiers **defer here by design** (no service-role key + blocked egress — the
  0148–0154 precedent): `verify:stop-roundtrip` exits 2 without the key; `verify:m2..m5,m45`,
  `verify:mainship-legacy-dock` need the target DB. They are the human apply gate below.
- **Remnant sweep clean:** no live import/JSX reference anywhere in `src/` to any deleted surface
  (ExpeditionLauncher, FleetStatusPanel, Dashboard, GalaxyMapScreen, CombatReportPage,
  CombatReportsView, MainShipPanel, MainShipPreview, DockServicesPanel, fleetGuards,
  lib/location — historical comments only); exactly ONE galaxy route (`/map`; `/`, `/galaxy`,
  `/reports`, `*` all resolve into the shell) and NO fleets UI (features/fleets holds only the
  api/types the data layer reads); ZERO raw palette literals across the shell, all four screens,
  and the shared primitives (full numeric-scale + hex grep). Jargon spot-check: player copy is
  humanized on all four destinations; `MainShipCommand`'s "currently {status}" interpolates plain
  English words (traveling/present/returning/home — fine); noted, not changed: `ActiveCombatPanel`
  (visible only during a live battle) kept its pre-goal interior — a candidate for a future combat
  polish slice, not a goal remnant.

**Goal exit criteria — met, with evidence:**
1. **Stop works on every leg.** Root cause: the consumed idempotency key survived success and
   replayed the first receipt (recon §D). Fix: `requestId: null` on the success branch of all
   three controllers (spaceStopCommand/portMoveCommand/spaceMoveCommand — slice 1, unit-proven);
   end-to-end proof authored: `verify:stop-roundtrip` (send→stop→send→stop on BOTH families + the
   consumed-key replay probe asserting the server settles nothing on a stale key).
2. **Navigation genuinely restructured.** ONE persistent mobile-first four-destination shell
   (Map · Ship · Port · Command; AppShell + nested routes; shared state fetched once; the arrival
   settle consolidated to one mount); the duplicate map path (ExpeditionLauncher) and ALL legacy
   fleets UI (FleetStatusPanel + the client legacy-leave affordance) DELETED with server plumbing
   untouched; all four interiors rebuilt in one design language (identity → right-now → details,
   StatRow/Meter, plain player language, no-softlock chain preserved, dark panels server-lit only).
3. **Map readable.** Migration `20260618000154` relocates exactly the five clustered waypoints to
   ≥29.2-world-unit pairwise separation (≈24% of the content span vs the ~9% no-overlap threshold),
   waypoints-only: ports/anchors/snapshots untouched, Dock-0 exact-match holds by construction
   (recon-proven; the migration guards it).

**THE CONSOLIDATED HUMAN APPLY-TIME CHECKLIST (in order — the owner's gate, never this loop):**
1. Apply migration **`20260618000154_map_declutter_waypoints.sql`** forward-only, after 0153
   (0152/0153 themselves are still pending apply per their own entries — apply 0152 → 0153 → 0154).
2. Run the engine suite: `npm run verify:m2 && npm run verify:m3 && npm run verify:m4 &&
   npm run verify:m5 && npm run verify:m45`.
3. Run `npm run verify:mainship-legacy-dock` (the 0152/0153 round-trip + constraint guards), then
   **`npm run verify:stop-roundtrip`** (send→stop→send→stop on both families + the consumed-key
   regression probe; a family whose flag is dark on that DB skips loudly with exit 2).
4. Visual map-readability pass at default zoom: five separated, labeled waypoints + three ports +
   home — no overlapping labels/markers.
5. Mobile-width (~390px) walkthrough of the four destinations: **Map** — select a destination →
   send; Stop visible mid-transit; dock at a port; **Ship** — repair reachable (disable via the
   dev path if desired), countdown while traveling, Return home when away; **Port** — docked shows
   the port card, undocked shows the friendly empty state; **Command** — base + battle history
   (reports), sign-out in the footer.

`docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` — confirmed unchanged across the WHOLE goal: client presentation +
a data-only waypoint relocation (Map stays sole writer of `locations`) + a client-only stop fix;
no server writer/table/constraint/cross-system call changed anywhere in these slices.

## 2026-07-06 — UI REBUILD (2b): Map interior — detail panel humanized, overlays organized, selector dedup

**The Map destination's interior rebuilt** — the galaxy canvas stays the hero; the location detail
panel and the feature overlays now speak the shared design language (identity → right-now →
details, `StatRow`, tokens only, plain player language):

- **Detail panel hierarchy:** IDENTITY (location name + a humanized kind + its zone, with one
  Badge: Port / Safe / Hostile) → RIGHT NOW (`MainShipCommand` — THE pick-a-destination → send
  flow, unchanged logic/testids, full-width primary CTA; flag-dark → omitted entirely) → DETAILS
  (humanized `StatRow`s). Phone-friendly: the aside is now a capped, scrollable bottom sheet
  (`max-h-[45dvh]`) below md. The local `Row` component is deleted (the shared `StatRow` rule).
- **The dev-jargon → player-language mapping (design decision, lives ONLY in MapScreen):**
  `location_type` → "Trade port / Pirate hunting ground / Pirate den / Safe waypoint / Mining
  site / Derelict station / Rally point / Event site"; `base_difficulty` → Danger "None — safe
  space / Low (≤10) / Moderate (≤20) / High"; `reward_tier` → Rewards "None / Modest / Good /
  Rich"; zone + sector shown as plain words (subtitle + a "Region" row). **DROPPED as
  dev-internal noise:** raw coordinates, raw `status` (get_world_map returns only active rows —
  the field could never read anything else), `pressure`/`danger_modifier` decimals, and the
  active-fleets debug count. The map data layer is untouched (locationStates stay polled;
  presentation simply no longer surfaces them).
- **Overlay organization (no logic/wiring/gating change):** PortNavPanel (top-left) and the stop
  CTAs (bottom-right) keep their existing token-styled overlay positions; the three server-lit
  feature panels (Exploration / Mining / WorldEvents) now ride ONE bottom-left overlay rail
  (positioned, scrollable, `pointer-events-none` shell) so that WHEN a capability lights they read
  as coherent map overlays instead of raw flow cards breaking the canvas layout — dark today, the
  rail renders empty and never intercepts map gestures. All server-lit `return null` gates
  verbatim. **No-softlock preserved verbatim:** legacy transit Stop, PortNav's OSN stop + the
  held-in-space re-departure surface, and GalaxyMap's coordinate-transit Stop all stay mounted on
  this destination, flag-independent by their own state predicates exactly as before.
- **Reviewer-flagged duplication fixed:** the "active legacy movement row of the main-ship fleet"
  derivation, previously computed in BOTH `AppShell` (settle wiring) and `MapScreen` (stop CTA),
  is now ONE shared selector — `selectActiveLegacyMovement` in `spaceStopCommand.ts` (the pure
  map-logic module) — called from both sites. Pure refactor, identical behavior;
  `spaceStopCommand.spec.ts` re-run green (10/10).

**Verification (honest):** `npm run build` green; `npm run lint` at the exact 22-error
pre-existing baseline (zero on touched files); zero raw palette literals on all touched surfaces
(grep-verified); preserved test ids (`galaxy-map-screen`, `galaxy-map-loading`/`-error`,
`galaxy-location-detail-panel`, all `mainship-*` command ids). The dark Map panels can't be
exercised live from this sandbox (server-lit; no service key + blocked egress) — their gates were
not modified. `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` unchanged (client-only presentation over unchanged
server ownership).

---

## 2026-07-06 — UI REBUILD (2b): Command interior — home base in the shared design language

**The Command destination rebuilt** (identity → right-now → details, `StatRow` rows, tokens only,
plain player language, mobile-first single column):
- **RIGHT-NOW focus rule (one focus per state, top-down):** pending onboarding first
  (`PortEntryPanel` — server-authoritative self-hide kept verbatim; its accent card is the screen's
  focus when the server says an action is needed) → any LIVE battle (`ActiveCombatPanel`, wiring
  untouched) → otherwise the base card's quiet all-clear line ("All quiet — nothing here needs
  your attention" + a set-out-from-the-Map hint), which CommandScreen suppresses while a battle is
  live so the combat panels hold the focus alone. No wall of equal-weight cards.
- **BasePanel interior rebuilt** (same file/props + a new `quiet` flag; presentation only, no RPC —
  the panel never had one): IDENTITY (base name + "Your home base"; the dev-jargon "(0, 0)"
  coordinate label dropped) → the right-now all-clear → DETAILS ("Stored resources" and "Garrison"
  as `StatRow` lists with mono tabular numbers; plain empty-states). **Honest scope note:** NO
  client production/build surface exists today — `train_units`/`cancel_build_order` have zero
  client call sites (the training UI was retired with the legacy fleet surfaces) — so no build
  section was invented (a new command surface is a capability decision, not presentation); the
  right-now third state is therefore the quiet state.
- **ReportsSection** adopted `StatRow` for its report facts (the local `Fact` label/value row
  deleted — the no-local-row rule); list/expand/round-log behavior unchanged. Dark `RankingPanel`
  keeps its server-lit `return null` gate verbatim — omitted while dark, never a placeholder.
- **Sign-out re-placed** as a quiet account footer (email + small ghost button) — a secondary
  affordance that no longer competes with base actions; behavior unchanged (no test id existed).
- **Dead code removed with its last caller:** `src/lib/location.ts` (`formatLocationLabel`) — its
  final imports died with FleetStatusPanel (nav-shell slice) and BasePanel's dropped coordinate
  label; zero call sites remained.

**Verification (honest):** `npm run build` green; `npm run lint` at the exact 22-error
pre-existing baseline (zero on touched files); zero raw palette literals on all touched surfaces
(grep-verified). The dark Command surface (Ranking) can't be exercised live from this sandbox
(server-lit; no service key + blocked egress) — its gate was not modified.
`docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` unchanged (client-only presentation over unchanged server ownership).

## 2026-07-06 — UI REBUILD (2b): Port interior — one docked-services surface, DockServicesPanel folded

**The Port destination rebuilt in the Ship-established design language** (identity → right-now →
details, `StatRow` rows, tokens only, plain player language, mobile-first single column):
- **NOT DOCKED:** one clear, friendly empty state ("Not docked / Dock at a port to access its
  services" + a travel-via-Map hint; testid `port-not-docked`) — keyed off the SAME
  server-authoritative dock projection as everything else (`useDockServices` → `isDocked`), no
  second source of docked truth, never a broken/blank screen.
- **DOCKED:** the new `src/features/port/DockedPortCard.tsx` — IDENTITY (the port's name as the
  title + "Docked" badge), RIGHT NOW ("Berth secured…" + the leave-via-Map hint; docking is a
  passive service, so the port's action surfaces are the server-lit panels below), DETAILS (each
  ACTIVE service as a plain-language `StatRow`: Docking → "Berth secured", Market → "Buy & sell
  goods", …; only what the server reported — never an inactive service).

**DockServicesPanel FOLDED and deleted:** its presentation became `DockedPortCard` (the old
absolute map-overlay styling died with the overlay mount — it had been floating wrongly inside the
Port flow since the shell slice); its dock read is now PortScreen's single `useDockServices` call —
this also retires the shell-slice double-read debt (the screen no longer reads the projection once
for the branch and again inside the panel). All test ids preserved (`dock-services-panel` /
`-title` / `-list` / `dock-service-<s>` / `-none`); the fail-closed `isDocked` render gate is kept
verbatim inside the card. `StatRow` gained rest-prop passthrough (the Card convention) so rows can
carry test ids — no new primitive added.

**Rendered-proof suite kept honest:** `tests/harness/dockServicesHarness.tsx` now mounts the REAL
composition PortScreen uses (`useDockServices` → `DockedPortCard`, same injected fetcher + `__fail`
path), and `tests/dockServicesUi.uispec.ts`'s copy assertions track the new presentation (the port
name IS the title; the old map-overlay half-width comment corrected). Dark panels
(`InvestmentPanel`, `MarketPanel` behind `TRADE_MARKET_ENABLED`) keep their server-lit gates
verbatim — surfaced only when lit, omitted otherwise. No flag, no command logic, no RPC change.

**Verification (honest):** `npm run build` green; `npm run lint` at the exact 22-error
pre-existing baseline (the harness's two immutability errors are pre-existing, line-shifted); zero
raw palette literals on all touched surfaces (grep-verified). The `.uispec.ts` rendered suites are
deliberately outside the default Playwright testMatch and need the CI browser runner (documented
precedent — this sandbox lacks it); attempted anyway ("No tests found" under the default config),
so the harness was additionally TYPE-CHECKED standalone (clean — only the expected standalone-tsc
`import.meta.env` vite-types gap, unrelated). Dark Port panels can't be exercised live
(server-lit; no service key + blocked egress). `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` unchanged (client-only
presentation over unchanged server ownership).

---

## 2026-07-06 — UI REBUILD (2b): Ship interior — the MainShipPreview + MainShipPanel MERGE

**The audit-mandated collapse, done:** `MainShipPreview` (card + repair + the only recall) and
`MainShipPanel` (derived status + destination countdown) are MERGED into ONE surface —
`src/features/ship/ShipStatusCard.tsx` — and both old files are DELETED (they had no other mount
after the shell slice). The union of capabilities is preserved: repair, recall ("Return home"),
live travel countdown + progress, hull integrity, cargo/fittings, the no-ship starter-hull teaser.
Same RPCs verbatim (`repair_main_ship` / `request_main_ship_return`), same double-submit guards,
same testids (`mainship-repair` / `mainship-recall` / error notes) — presentation restructure only.

**The hierarchy (the design language the other destinations will reuse):** (1) IDENTITY — ship
name + hull subtitle + one state Badge + a hull-integrity Meter; (2) RIGHT NOW — one prominent
primary-action block for the current state (Repair when disabled · the live countdown + progress
when under way, with a "use Stop on the Map" hint · Return-home when away · a quiet "ready to fly"
line at home); (3) DETAILS — plain-language stat rows (Cargo hold / Speed / Captain seats / Module
slots). Dev-jargon labels replaced ("Readiness (HP)" → hull integrity; raw status words → player
sentences). Mobile-first: single column at ~390px, full-width ≥44px action buttons.

**Data/wiring:** the card is fed from the shell's already-polled state (`game.mainShip` +
`map.mainShipFleet`/`movements`) — the old preview's self-fetch existed only because the pre-shell
overlay had no shared state; no new fetch, no polling change, no command-logic change.
**No-softlock:** Repair now renders whenever the ship is disabled, INDEPENDENT of the send flag —
matching the server's deliberately ungated repair safelock (0052:120); previously the preview's
repair block sat inside its send-flag branch. Return-home stays send-flag-gated exactly as before
(its RPC is flag-gated server-side). Dark Ship panels (Modules / Captains / Recruit / ShipSwitcher)
keep their server-lit `return null` gates verbatim — surfaced only when lit, omitted otherwise.

**New shared primitive (ONE, needed now):** `src/components/ui/StatRow.tsx` — the label/value
stat row (inside a `<dl>`), exported from the ui index. Ship uses it first; Port/Command/Map
detail lists adopt it in their interior slices (each still carries a local Row/Fact copy of this
exact pattern — to be replaced, not duplicated). No other abstraction added.

**Dead code removed with its last caller:** `src/features/fleets/fleetGuards.ts`
(`isMainShipFleet`) — its final import died with MainShipPanel; the Phase-10E legacy/main-ship UI
isolation it guarded is now STRUCTURAL (no legacy fleet surface exists in the client at all; the
server RPCs and their guards are untouched).

**Verification (honest):** `npm run build` green; `npm run lint` at the exact 22-error
pre-existing baseline (zero on touched files); zero raw palette literals on all touched surfaces
(grep-verified). Dark Ship panels can't be exercised live from this sandbox (server-lit; no
service key + blocked egress) — their gates were not modified. `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`
unchanged (client-only presentation over unchanged server ownership).

---

## 2026-07-06 — UI REBUILD (2b): the persistent four-destination nav shell (structure + navigation)

**The restructure (not a re-skin):** ONE persistent, mobile-first bottom tab bar — **Map · Ship ·
Port · Command** — replaces the old link-hopping between three sibling routes. Audit + locked
target: `UIREBUILD_AUDIT.local.md`. This slice is structure/navigation + the two deletions; each
destination's interior redesign is the following per-screen slices (panels were RELOCATED
unchanged).

**BEFORE → AFTER screen inventory (the 2e before→after record):**
- **Routes before:** `/` Dashboard (base + port-entry + main-ship status + combat + expedition
  launcher + fleets list + inline reports + dark ranking), `/galaxy` GalaxyMapScreen (map + preview
  overlay + port-nav + stops + dock services + 8 dark panels + detail/send), `/reports`
  CombatReportPage, `/auth`, `*`→`/`. Navigation was three header links; no persistent nav.
- **Routes after:** `/map`, `/ship`, `/port`, `/command` under the ONE `AppShell` (bottom tab bar,
  ≥44px targets, tokens only, active tab from the router); `/` → `/map` (the primary play surface);
  legacy `/galaxy` → `/map` and `/reports` → `/command` redirects keep old bookmarks working;
  `/auth` + `*` fallback unchanged.
- **Map** (`src/features/map/MapScreen.tsx`): galaxy canvas + location detail with the ONE in-map
  send flow (MainShipCommand) + PortNavPanel (travel + OSN stop + the held-in-space re-departure
  surface) + the legacy transit Stop CTA + dark coordinate targeting + dark Exploration / Mining /
  WorldEvents (server-lit gates verbatim).
- **Ship** (`src/features/ship/ShipScreen.tsx`): MainShipPreview (card + repair + the ONLY recall)
  and MainShipPanel (status + destination countdown) relocated side by side — their MERGE into one
  surface is the Ship interior slice; dark Modules / Captains / RecruitCaptain / ShipSwitcher
  (server-lit gates verbatim; omitted while dark, never dead panels).
- **Port** (`src/features/port/PortScreen.tsx`): docked-only — DockServicesPanel + dark Investment
  / Market, keyed off the SAME server docked projection (`isDocked`); when not docked, a friendly
  "Not docked — dock at a port to access its services" empty state (never a broken screen).
- **Command** (`src/features/command/CommandScreen.tsx`): BasePanel + PortEntryPanel onboarding +
  ActiveCombatPanel(s) + the MERGED reports section + dark RankingPanel + sign-out.
- **DELETED (the two user-reported failures):** `ExpeditionLauncher` (the duplicate map path — a
  Card that only linked to /galaxy; the send flow already lives IN the map, so nothing to fold) and
  `FleetStatusPanel` (ALL legacy fleets UI, including the client legacy-leave affordance
  `fleetApi.requestLeaveLocation` — no client call path to `request_leave_location` remains). The
  server-side `fleets` rows, RPCs, and movement plumbing are UNTOUCHED (load-bearing main-ship
  plumbing; `fleetGuards.isMainShipFleet` stays, used by MainShipPanel).
- **MERGED:** the `/reports` CombatReportPage + the inline CombatReportsView → ONE
  `ReportsSection` in Command (list + on-expand round-log fetch, fed from the shell's polled combat
  state instead of its own triple fetch). Empty shells deleted: Dashboard.tsx, GalaxyMapScreen.tsx,
  CombatReportPage.tsx, CombatReportsView.tsx.

**Shared state lifted (fetched once):** the three polled hooks (`useGalaxyMapData`, `useGameState`,
`useCombat`) mount exactly once in `AppShell` and reach destinations via `useShellState`
(`src/app/shellState.ts`) — no destination mounts its own copy. **Consolidated arrival settle:**
the old Dashboard mounted `useSettleDueArrival` for the legacy leg and GalaxyMapScreen for the OSN
leg — safe only while those routes were mutually exclusive; with a persistent shell that invariant
is gone, so the hook now mounts EXACTLY ONCE in AppShell covering BOTH `legacyMovement` and the OSN
`movement`, and both per-screen mountings are removed.

**Dark stays dark:** every dark panel keeps its server-lit `return null` gate verbatim and is
surfaced only when already lit — no flag flipped, no capability activated, no server change.
**No-softlock preserved:** all three Stop CTAs + PortNav re-departure live on Map (mounted
flag-independent, state-predicated as before); repair (MainShipPreview) mounts UNGATED on Ship.

**Verification (honest):** `npm run build` green (bundle −7 kB from the deletions);
`npm run lint` back to the exact 22-error pre-existing baseline (zero errors in any new/touched
file; one new-file react-refresh hit was fixed by moving the context/hook into `shellState.ts`).
Zero raw palette literals on all new/kept surfaces (grep-verified). The deployed-site browser
smoke (`tests/galaxy.spec.ts`) was updated to the new flow (sign-in lands directly on Map; the
"Galaxy map" link/heading assertions are gone) — it runs against the DEPLOYED site, so it passes
only once this UI deploys; dark panels/flows could not be exercised live from this sandbox
(server-lit; no service key + blocked egress). `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` unchanged — client-only
navigation over unchanged server ownership (no table/writer/constraint/cross-system call changed).

## 2026-07-06 — MAP DECLUTTER: waypoint relocation (migration 0154, data-only)

**Problem (root cause, full trace in `MAP_DECLUTTER_RECON.local.md`):** the 0002 waypoints were
seeded 1–3.6 world units apart on the tiny legacy map scale, while the 0066 starter ports sit on
the OSN scale (−50…80). The content-fit camera (galaxyCamera `fitCameraToWorldPoints`, MAX_K=1024)
frames the 120-unit port spread, compressing the two waypoint clusters to ~8–20 screen px — with
counter-scaled constant-size markers/labels that means overlapping halos and unreadable labels at
default zoom (min pairwise separation 1.2% of the content span vs the ~9% no-overlap threshold).

**Migration `20260618000154_map_declutter_waypoints.sql` (forward-only; no shipped file touched):**
relocates ONLY the five waypoint `locations` rows, matched by their post-0148 one-word zone-scoped
`(zone_id, name)` key — the exact 0148 idiom (single fail-closed atomic do-block; presence check,
GET DIAGNOSTICS exactly-5-rows guard, exact-coordinate read-back, ports-untouched guard;
idempotent re-run — a same-value UPDATE still matches all five and the read-back accepts
already-at-target):

| waypoint | zone | before | after |
|---|---|---|---|
| Refuge (safe) | Wreck Belt | (11, 5) | (−30, 15) |
| Snare (pirate d10) | Wreck Belt | (12, 6) | (−15, 40) |
| Reaver (pirate d15) | Wreck Belt | (9, 4) | (−45, 40) |
| Lull (safe) | Ion Storm Route | (31, 22) | (40, 30) |
| Blackden (pirate d25) | Ion Storm Route | (33, 23) | (65, 55) |

The content bbox (x −50…70, y −30…80) is unchanged, so the default zoom is unchanged; min pairwise
separation over all nine map points (8 locations + the (0,0) home base) becomes **29.2 world units
≈ 24% of span** (≈163 px at default fit vs the ≈60 px label requirement — >2.5× margin,
viewport-independent). Distance-from-home now orders by difficulty (Refuge 33.5 < Snare 42.7 <
Lull 50 < Reaver 60.2 < Blackden 85.1 — the old seed had the d15 site as the CLOSEST point of all
at 9.85u); zone geography preserved (Wreck Belt trio west with Haven, Ion Storm pair east with
Slagworks/Driftmarch).

**Deliberately untouched (the recon's blast-radius proof):** NO port row, NO `space_anchors` row
(the waypoints have none; the unmoved ports keep the 0066 anchor==location alignment, guarded
in-migration), NO `fleet_movements`/`main_ship_space_movements` snapshot backfill (per-trip
snapshots settle by IDs; rewriting in-flight geometry would teleport moving ships), NO function,
flag, config, or grant. Dock-0's exact-match compares the ANCHOR to the movement snapshot
(0067:564-572) and locations.x/y is consulted NOWHERE in the OSN domain — so docking holds by
construction. Legacy sends read `l.x/l.y` LIVE at send time, so future waypoint trips get ~2.8×
longer on average; `travel_scale` / `min_travel_seconds` remain the human-owned pacing knobs (no
value changed here). **STANDING INVARIANT for any FUTURE port relocation:** move `locations.x/y`
and retire+insert the port's anchor in ONE migration (0063 lifecycle), same values both places
(0066 invariant), accepting `target_anchor_changed` terminal failures for routes in flight at
apply time — deliberate, never a silent redirect.

**Verification (honest; environmental precedent unchanged — 0148–0153 "authored, reviewed, NOT
applied"):** no service-role key in this sandbox and network egress is blocked, so the migration
was verified statically: one balanced `do $$ … $$;` block; the five-row GET DIAGNOSTICS guard;
exact-coordinate read-back for all five; the three fixed-UUID port rows asserted still at their
0066 coords; idempotent-re-run semantics reasoned through (same-value update → count 5 → read-back
passes). `verify:m2` asserts waypoint NAMES + types only (scripts/verify-m2.mjs:77-93), never
coordinates — it stays green post-apply. `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` unchanged (Map remains the
sole writer of `locations`; no writer/table/constraint/cross-system call changed).
**HUMAN CHECKLIST (the owner's gate):** (1) apply 0154 after 0148–0153, forward-only; (2) re-run
`verify:m2` + `verify:mainship-legacy-dock` + `verify:stop-roundtrip` (ports/anchors unmoved —
both stop families unaffected); (3) visual pass of the galaxy map at default zoom (five separated,
labeled waypoints); (4) optionally retune `travel_scale`/`min_travel_seconds` if the ~2.8× longer
legacy waypoint trips should keep their old wall-clock feel.

## 2026-07-06 — STOP/MOVE FIX, slice 2: the send→stop→send→stop verifier

**New verifier `scripts/verify-stop-roundtrip.mjs`** (+ `package.json` script `verify:stop-roundtrip`)
— proves goal item (1) end-to-end: Stop works on EVERY in-transit leg, not just the first. It proves
the SERVER-side contract the slice-1 client fix relies on (each stop sent with a FRESH request id
halts exactly ITS OWN leg); slice-1's controller unit tests prove the client now emits that fresh key
per leg — the two layers together close the goal. Covers BOTH stop families plus the regression probe:

1. **Legacy family** (`fleet_movements` / `command_main_ship_stop_transit`): commissioned-docked
   departure (`move_main_ship_to_location`) → stop 1 transforms THE leg-1 row in place to
   `mission_type='return_home'` (target = home base), fleet `returning`, ship `returning/NULL` →
   settles home (on-demand 0151 settle + cron-poll backstop, ship reconciled `home` by the 0050 cron)
   → `send_main_ship_expedition` leg 2 (asserted a FRESH fleet row) → stop 2 transforms the leg-2 row
   identically — each stop owns exactly its own trip, twice over.
2. **OSN family** (the live-reachable defect; `main_ship_space_movements` /
   `command_main_ship_space_stop`): anchored departure via `command_main_ship_space_move_to_location`
   → stop 1 with a fresh key (`outcome:'stopped'`, movement `stopped/player_stop`, ship HELD
   `stationary/in_space` at its own coordinates) → leg 2 re-departs FROM the held-in-space state as a
   NEW movement → stop 2 with a second fresh key halts the SECOND movement (its own `movement_id`) —
   the exact reported "second leg" scenario, proven to stop. Wrapper calls try the 0083
   (`p_main_ship_id`) shape first and fall back to the pre-0083 shape (schema-cache-miss fallback).
3. **Regression probe (documents WHY slice 1 was required):** on the fresh in-transit leg 2, a stop
   submitted with the PREVIOUSLY-CONSUMED leg-1 key is asserted to REPLAY the leg-1 receipt verbatim
   (the OLD `movement_id` in the envelope) and to settle NOTHING — leg 2 stays `moving`. That replay
   was the live "second Stop no-ops" bug; the probe pins the server contract (receipts are
   correct-by-design idempotency) so the fresh-key-per-leg client fix is provably the right layer.
   The probe is OSN-only by nature: the legacy stop carries no request key (idempotent by state).

**Idiom (mirrors `verify-mainship-legacy-dock-travel.mjs` verbatim):** `loadEnv`/admin/`newUser`/
`poll`/`setCfg`, up-front capture of `travel_scale`/`min_travel_seconds` (set fast for the run,
restored in `finally`), shared `teardownVerifier` for user cleanup, §11–§13 SKIP-loudly probes
(commissioning absent, target-legal probe absent, no second dockable port). **NO capability flag is
toggled — stricter than the sibling:** `mainship_send_enabled` and `mainship_space_movement_enabled`
are READ ONLY; a family whose flag is dark on the target DB is SKIPPED loudly instead of
force-enabled (`teardownVerifier` is passed `flag: null`). Exit contract: 1 on any failed assertion;
**2 when anything was skipped** (required capability absent / a family dark — "not fully proven");
0 only when both families ran green.

**Verification of this step (honest):** `node --check scripts/verify-stop-roundtrip.mjs` → OK.
`npm run build` green. `npm run lint` → the same 22 pre-existing errors in untouched files (the new
`.mjs` sits outside ESLint's `**/*.{ts,tsx}` coverage; no ts/tsx file touched this slice). **DB
execution deferred:** no `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in this sandbox AND network egress is blocked
(the 0148–0153 precedent) — the verifier exits 2 by design without the key. Authored + statically
reviewed only. `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` unchanged (verifier-only slice — no table, writer,
constraint, or cross-system call changed).

**MIGRATION-APPLY / ENABLE-TIME CHECKLIST ADDITION (the human owner's gate):** after applying the
pending migrations (0152→0153) and/or whenever the stop families are enabled on the target DB, ALSO
run **`npm run verify:stop-roundtrip`** — confirms `send → stop → send → stop` lands on both
families and the consumed-key replay settles nothing. (Supplements the slice-3 checklist in the
MAINSHIP LEGACY SPATIAL-STATE FIX entry below; a family dark on that DB skips loudly with exit 2.)

## 2026-07-06 — STOP/MOVE FIX, slice 1: consumed idempotency keys cleared on success (client-only)

**Bug (LIVE — the reported "second Stop no-ops"):** the three pure OSN command controllers kept
their idempotency `requestId` after a SUCCESS. The server receipt idempotency is correct-by-design
(`mainship_space_stop` replays the stored `result_json` verbatim for a matching
`(main_ship_id, request_id)` — 0067:695-704 — and Stop's canonical payload hash is CONSTANT, so a
stale key can't even conflict), and the controller instances survive across trips (memoized on
`[mainShipId]`; PortNavPanel/GalaxyMap stay mounted, returning `null` between trips). So the second
Stop on a NEW transit resubmitted the FIRST stop's consumed key → the server replayed trip 1's
success envelope → the new movement kept flying while the UI showed "Stopped in open space." — a
silent no-op. Full root-cause trace: `STOP_UIRESTRUCTURE_RECON.local.md` §D. Same class, siblings:
`portMoveCommand` (re-travel to the SAME destination after a success replayed the old receipt → no
new movement; live-reachable) and `spaceMoveCommand` (identical idiom; dark behind the 0070
coordinate gate). The legacy stop (`useLegacyStopTransitCommand` → 0149) does NOT share the class:
per-trip fleet keying + idempotent-by-state server (no receipts) — clean post-0152, untouched.

**Fix (client-only; NO migration, NO server code, NO flag — the server behaves as designed):**
each controller's `submit()` success branch now ALSO sets `requestId: null` — the key is consumed
by the success. Error/catch branches still keep the key, so a retry-after-error stays idempotent
(same key), while the NEXT command after a completed one always generates a fresh key.
- `src/features/map/spaceStopCommand.ts` — `createSpaceStopController.submit` `res.ok` branch
  (+ the now-corrected key-lifecycle comment). ONE shared controller serves BOTH
  `useSpaceStopCommand` (the live-reachable OSN stop — PortNavPanel/GalaxyMap) and
  `useLegacyStopTransitCommand`, so this single change repairs the reported second-leg OSN stop.
- `src/features/map/portMoveCommand.ts` — `createPortMoveController.submit` `res.ok` branch
  (+ the `PortMoveState.requestId` comment).
- `src/features/map/spaceMoveCommand.ts` — `createSpaceMoveController.submit` `res.ok` branch,
  preserving the existing `serverTarget` reconciliation (+ the `SpaceMoveState.requestId` comment).

**Deliberate omissions (considered, NOT done):** (1) movement-id re-keying of the OSN stop hook —
redundant once the consumed key is cleared on success (every trip already gets a fresh key);
speculative plumbing out of this slice's scope. (2) A shared "idempotent submit" helper across the
three controllers — they are pre-existing independent surfaces with distinct state shapes; a
one-field `requestId: null` in each controller's own success branch is not a duplicated
non-trivial block.

**Tests (updated to the corrected contract):** `tests/spaceStopCommand.spec.ts` /
`tests/portMoveCommand.spec.ts` / `tests/spaceMoveCommand.spec.ts` — after a successful `submit()`
`state.requestId` is `null`, and the NEXT submit (new trip / re-selected SAME destination) calls
`genRequestId` again and sends a DIFFERENT key; the pre-existing error/catch retry cases (same key
reused) are unchanged and still pass.

**Verification (honest):** `npm run build` (tsc + vite) green; `npm run lint` green on the five
touched files (the suite's 22 pre-existing errors in untouched files are unchanged);
`verify:osn:osn4` + `verify:osn:port` + `verify:osn:s6c` (the three controller spec files) green.
No DB needed — this slice is pure client logic. `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` unchanged (no table,
writer, constraint, or cross-system call changed). **NEXT SLICE:** the end-to-end
`send → stop → send → stop` verifier (`verify:stop-roundtrip`, both families — see the recon §D.2
assertion list).

## 2026-07-06 — MAINSHIP LEGACY SPATIAL-STATE FIX, slice 3: the end-to-end round-trip verifier

**New verifier `scripts/verify-mainship-legacy-dock-travel.mjs`** (+ `package.json` script
`verify:mainship-legacy-dock`) — proves the EXACT live scenario the hotfix targets, end-to-end:

1. `commission_first_main_ship` (NOT `ensure_main_ship_for_player`) → asserts the canonical DOCKED start
   (`status='stationary', spatial_state='at_location', space_x/y NULL`) — the state the live bug fired from.
2. Picks destinations from the world map via `mainship_space_location_target_legal` (admin RPC): a
   DOCKABLE port `D` (`ok:true`, distinct from the current dock) AND a NON-dockable active `'none'`
   safe-zone `N` (`ok:false` — Safe Rally Point / Quiet Drift); dies loudly if either kind is missing.
3. **Regression guard 1 (the reported live bug):** docked → `move_main_ship_to_location(fleet, D)` returns
   NO error (pre-0152: `ss_at_location_status` violation) and the ship drops to legacy in-flight
   (`traveling` / `spatial_state NULL` / coords NULL — `mainship_mark_legacy_in_flight`).
4. Settles the arrival (on-demand legacy settle + cron-poll backstop) → fleet present at `D`, active
   presence at `D`, and the SHIP re-docked canonically (0153's shared `mainship_mark_docked_at_location`)
   — the docked→send→travel→arrive→docked loop closed with zero constraint violation.
5. **Non-dock fallback:** `D`→`N` settles with the fleet present at `N` and the ship staying
   `spatial_state=NULL` (coherent `legacy_present`; nothing writes the ship).
6. **Regression guard 2 (the second live bug):** re-docks at `D`, then `request_main_ship_return` from the
   DOCKED ship returns NO error → ship `returning` / `spatial_state NULL` → settles home (fleet completed).
7. **Constraint guard (BEHAVIORAL — documented in the script header):** PostgREST exposes no `pg_constraint`
   path and the repo ships no introspection RPC, so instead of a metadata query the guard attempts each
   illegal direct write (service-role — bypasses RLS, never CHECKs) and asserts Postgres REJECTS it naming
   the constraint. Each probe runs from a ship state where EXACTLY ONE lifecycle constraint is violated,
   so the reported constraint name is deterministic (a docked ship's `spatial_state→in_transit/home/
   destroyed` would violate `stationary_spatial_state` too — ambiguous which fires): from DOCKED —
   `ss_at_location_status` (the verbatim pre-0152 live write `status→traveling`) and
   `stationary_spatial_state` (`spatial_state→NULL`); from in-flight TRAVELING — `ss_home_status`,
   `ss_destroyed_status`, and `ss_in_space_status` (`in_space` carries coords 1,1 so the 0054
   `space_coords` rule is satisfied and only the lifecycle rule fires); from RETURNING —
   `ss_in_transit_status` (from `traveling` that write would be the LEGAL OSN pair and would succeed).
   All SIX covered — proving they still EXIST and ENFORCE (strictly stronger than presence). The fix
   corrected the WRITERS, never the constraints.

**Proof principle (script header):** every RPC returning without error across steps 3–6 IS the
constraint-never-violated proof — a violating write raises inside the RPC and fails it (that raise WAS the
live bug). **Idiom:** mirrors `verify-mainship-move.mjs` (`loadEnv`/admin/`newUser`/`poll`/`setCfg`,
up-front capture of `mainship_send_enabled`/`travel_scale`/`min_travel_seconds`, shared
`teardownVerifier` restore in `finally` — no re-implemented teardown; NO OSN flag is toggled). Deployment
probes SKIP loudly (§11–§13 idiom) when 0152/0153's helpers or commissioning (starter ports) are absent.

**Verification of this step (honest):** `node --check` → OK. `npm run lint` → 22 errors, ALL pre-existing
in `src/`/`tests/` ts+tsx files this step never touched (ESLint's config lints `**/*.{ts,tsx}` only — the
new `.mjs` is outside its coverage; `git status` shows zero src/tests modifications, so HEAD lints
identically). DB execution deferred: no `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in this sandbox AND network egress is
blocked (the 0148–0153 precedent) — the verifier exits 2 by design without the key.

**MIGRATION-APPLY VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (the human owner's gate — supersedes the slice-1/2 lists):**
1. Apply migrations **0152 → 0153** (forward-only, in order, after 0148–0151).
2. `npm run verify:m2 && npm run verify:m3 && npm run verify:m4 && npm run verify:m5 && npm run verify:m45`
   (suite stays green), plus `npm run verify:mainship-send` / `npm run verify:mainship-move`.
3. **`npm run verify:mainship-legacy-dock`** — confirms a docked ship departs/returns and re-docks with no
   CHECK violation (regression guards for both live bugs), the non-dock fallback, and all six 0055
   constraints still enforcing.
4. Confirm no client execute grants changed (the four legacy RPCs keep `authenticated`; both 0152/0153
   helpers and the re-created internals stay client-revoked).

## 2026-07-06 — MAINSHIP LEGACY SPATIAL-STATE FIX, slice 2: legacy arrival docks the ship (migration 0153)

**Gap closed:** `movement_settle_arrival`'s location branch (0151) settled the FLEET (`fleet_set_present`
+ `presence_create`) but never the SHIP — a legacy-arrived main ship sat `status='traveling'`,
`spatial_state=NULL` while "present" (decision-doc §2 writer #6). Post-0152 a docked→send→arrive trip
would end in `legacy_present` instead of returning to the canonical docked pair.

**Migration `20260618000153_mainship_legacy_arrival_docks_ship.sql` (forward-only; no shipped file touched).**
1. **`mainship_mark_docked_at_location(p_main_ship_id)`** — THE one canonical docked-ship write
   (`status='stationary', spatial_state='at_location', space_x/y=NULL`; Main-Ship-owned leaf; SECURITY
   DEFINER; service_role-only, clients revoked) — the arrival-side mirror of 0152's
   `mainship_mark_legacy_in_flight`. Shared by BOTH docking routes (the OSN Dock-0 writer AND the legacy
   arrival settle); the docked-pair write now exists in exactly ONE place. **RETIREMENT:** when the legacy
   `fleet_movements` main-ship family is replaced by the OSN coordinate domain, Dock-0 becomes the sole
   caller and the write may fold back inline (same condition as 0152's helper).
2. **`mainship_space_dock_at_location` re-created from its LATEST shipped body (0067:499 — the anchor-backed
   Dock-0 re-creation; the 0061 birth body is superseded — the 0152 latest-body precedent)** with ONLY the
   dock-branch inline ship write (0067:618-621) swapped for the helper call; the terminal-failure `in_space`
   write and everything else are byte-identical (scripted diff: two hunks — the swap and the honestly
   amended settlement-timestamp comment). **Accepted micro-delta (documented in-file):** the dock branch's
   SHIP `updated_at` is now stamped `now()` by the shared helper instead of `v_settled_at` —
   bookkeeping-only; the settlement record (movement `resolved_at` + fleets stamps) keeps `v_settled_at`
   exactly.
3. **`movement_settle_arrival` re-created from 0151 body-verbatim** (scripted diff: two hunks — the
   `v_main_ship uuid` declare and the new block) with the location branch gaining, after `presence_create`:
   look up `fleets.main_ship_id`; if non-NULL AND `mainship_space_location_target_legal(target)` passes →
   `mainship_mark_docked_at_location(ship)` (coherent `at_location`: `fleet_set_present` already set
   present/location-mode/`active_movement_id=NULL`, presence matches); otherwise write NOTHING — a
   main-ship fleet at an active `'none'` but NON-dockable target (seed safe-zones Safe Rally Point / Quiet
   Drift — the reachable §3 case) stays in the constraint-legal `legacy_present` NULL representation from
   its 0152 departure write, and ordinary unit fleets (`main_ship_id` NULL) are untouched. The
   `target_type='base'` branch, `process_fleet_movements`, `process_mainship_space_arrivals`, and both
   on-demand settle RPCs are UNTOUCHED — they delegate here and inherit the fix.
4. **Execute surface:** CREATE OR REPLACE preserves grants on the two re-created internals (both were
   client-revoked at creation); only the NEW helper is locked (revoke public/anon/authenticated → grant
   service_role). `movement_settle_arrival`'s new call to the service_role predicate runs as function owner
   inside SECURITY DEFINER — NO client grant surface changes anywhere.

**Verification (honest; environmental precedent unchanged — 0148–0152 "authored, reviewed, NOT applied"):**
no psql/docker/supabase CLI in this sandbox and network egress is blocked (supabase host probe → HTTP 000),
so `verify:m*` cannot reach any database from here. Statically verified: the two scripted per-function
diffs above (only the intended hunks); 3 `create or replace` / 3 `$$;` / SECURITY DEFINER +
`set search_path = public` on all 3; exactly TWO `update main_ship_instances` in the file (the helper's
docked write + the verbatim terminal-failure `in_space` write); the docked-pair write appears exactly ONCE;
grant statements touch ONLY the new helper; no blanket re-lock.
**HUMAN CHECKLIST (the owner's gate — never this loop):** (1) apply 0153 after 0152, forward-only;
(2) re-run `verify:m2..m5,m45` + `verify:mainship-send` / `verify:mainship-move` + the OSN settle verifier,
and run **`npm run verify:mainship-legacy-dock`** (slice 3 — the round-trip + regression-guard verifier;
see the slice-3 entry's canonical checklist); (3) confirm no client execute grants changed post-apply (the
four legacy RPCs keep `authenticated`; the two re-created internals and both helpers stay client-revoked);
(4) confirm a commissioned ship's docked→send→travel→arrive-at-port trip ends
`status='stationary', spatial_state='at_location'` with no CHECK violation, and an arrival at
Safe Rally Point / Quiet Drift ends `legacy_present` (`spatial_state=NULL`) — item (4) is exactly what the
slice-3 verifier automates.

## 2026-07-06 — MAINSHIP LEGACY SPATIAL-STATE FIX, slice 1: departure/halt pair-writes (migration 0152)

**Bug (LIVE):** every legacy main-ship status writer was spatial_state-blind. Commissioned ships are
canonically docked (`status='stationary', spatial_state='at_location'` — 0072, ungated/live) with their
fleet `'present'`, which is exactly what the legacy send surface accepts — so
`move_main_ship_to_location` (0053:105, sets `'traveling'`) and `request_main_ship_return` (0051:213,
sets `'returning'`) left `spatial_state='at_location'` behind and tripped the 0055
`ss_at_location_status` CHECK, aborting the whole RPC. Full recon/audit + design decision:
`docs/MAINSHIP_LEGACY_SPATIAL_STATE_FIX.md` (the constraints are CORRECT; the writers were the defect).

**Migration `20260618000152_mainship_legacy_in_flight_spatial_state.sql` (forward-only; no shipped file touched).**
1. **`mainship_mark_legacy_in_flight(p_main_ship_id, p_status)`** — THE one legacy in-flight ship write
   (Main-Ship-owned leaf; SECURITY DEFINER; service_role-only, clients revoked): guards
   `p_status ∈ ('traveling','returning')` (raises otherwise), then one statement sets
   `status = p_status, spatial_state = NULL, space_x = NULL, space_y = NULL, updated_at = now()`.
   The legacy family lives entirely in the `spatial_state=NULL` domain (decision doc §5) — it never
   claims `in_transit`/`in_space`. **RETIREMENT CONDITION:** the helper retires together with its four
   callers when the legacy `fleet_movements` main-ship family is replaced by the OSN coordinate domain.
2. **Four writers re-created body-VERBATIM with ONLY the bare status UPDATE swapped for the helper call**
   (scripted extraction + `diff` against 0051/0053/0149 shows exactly one hunk per function — the swap
   itself; every gate, precondition, comment, and signature is byte-identical):
   `send_main_ship_expedition` + `request_main_ship_return` (0051 bodies),
   `move_main_ship_to_location` (0053 body), `command_main_ship_stop_transit` (0149 body).
   The `mainship_send_enabled` gate lines are verbatim-unchanged (no flag created/read differently/flipped).
3. **Execute surface:** CREATE OR REPLACE on an existing function PRESERVES owner + grants, so the four
   RPCs keep their `authenticated` EXECUTE automatically — deliberately NO blanket
   `revoke execute on all functions` re-lock (that idiom is for migrations adding NEW client RPCs). Only
   the NEW helper is locked: revoke from public/anon/authenticated, grant to service_role.

**Verification (honest; environmental precedent unchanged from 0148–0151 "authored, reviewed, NOT
applied"):** no psql/docker/supabase CLI in this sandbox AND network egress is blocked (`verify:m2`/`m3`
fail with `fetch failed` on plain world-map reads; `example.com` is equally unreachable — the suite
cannot reach ANY database from here, and the handful of m2 "write blocked ✓" lines are fetch-failure
false positives, not assertions). The migration was therefore verified statically: the per-function
diff proof above; 5 `create or replace` / 5 `$$;` terminators / SECURITY DEFINER +
`set search_path = public` on all 5 / exactly 4 helper call sites / exactly ONE
`update main_ship_instances` in the file (inside the helper); grant statements touch ONLY the helper.
**HUMAN CHECKLIST (the owner's gate — never this loop):** (1) apply 0152 after 0148–0151, forward-only;
(2) re-run `verify:m2..m5,m45` + `verify:mainship-send` / `verify:mainship-move`; (3) confirm the four
RPCs still hold `authenticated` EXECUTE post-apply (ACL query or an authenticated call probe) — expected
preserved by CREATE OR REPLACE semantics; (4) confirm a commissioned (`at_location`) ship can now
depart/return via the legacy surface without a CHECK violation. **NEXT SLICE (not in 0152):** the
ARRIVAL half — `movement_settle_arrival`'s location branch settling the ship (docked pair via a
transition shared with the OSN dock writer; legacy fallback for non-dockable 'none' targets) + the
docked→send→travel→arrive→docked verifier.

## 2026-07-06 — VISUAL FOLLOW-ON item 4 (final sweep): palette-literal inventory; last live straggler converted

**Sweep:** grepped `src/` (`*.ts`/`*.tsx`) for `white/`, `black/`, plain `text/bg/border-white|black`,
`slate-`, `indigo-`, `rose-`, `red-`, `emerald-`, `amber-`, `cyan-`, `sky-`, `violet-`, `zinc-`,
`gray-`, and raw hex in JSX attributes. Every hit classified live-visible vs. dark before touching
anything (each dark panel's fail-closed server-lit gate re-verified at its `return null` site).

**Converted (the ONLY live-visible straggler):** `src/app/RequireAuth.tsx` — the auth-gate loading
screen's `text-white/40` → `text-ink-muted`. One class; no logic touched.

**ACKNOWLEDGED DEBT (standing note — intentionally NOT converted):** the dark, flag-gated panels retain
incidental palette literals because they render `null` in production (server-rejected capability +
client fail-closed gate), so they have zero visual surface today:
- `investment/InvestmentPanel.tsx` (22 hits; `location_investment_enabled` dark)
- `modules/ModulesPanel.tsx` (20; `module_crafting_enabled`/`module_fitting_enabled` dark)
- `map/SpaceMoveTarget.tsx` (18; mounts only behind `canTarget` — server
  `coordinate_travel_available` + `mainship_space_movement_enabled`, both dark)
- `mining/MiningPanel.tsx` (11; `mining_enabled` dark)
- `exploration/ExplorationPanel.tsx` (10; `exploration_enabled` dark)
- `captains/CaptainsPanel.tsx` (9; `captain_assignment_enabled` dark)
- `events/WorldEventsPanel.tsx` (8; `phase20_polish_enabled` dark — feed empties, panel nulls)
- `captains/RecruitCaptainPanel.tsx` (7; captain-system server-lit visibility, dark)
- `map/DevFixedSpacePreview.tsx` (3 hex SVG strokes; `import.meta.env.DEV`-only — statically
  compile-time eliminated from `vite build`, never shipped at all)
**RETIREMENT CONDITION:** each panel is converted to the design system in the SAME change that lights
its capability flag (the "lit-path" work for that feature) — a panel must not go live wearing
off-system chrome. Until lit, do not restyle them speculatively.

**Presentational-only:** no behavior/handler/`data-testid`/route/flag/backend change anywhere in the
sweep; `src/components/ui/**` and `@theme` tokens untouched. Post-sweep grep: the only remaining
palette-literal files are exactly the nine listed above. `npm run build` (incl. `tsc -b`) green.

---

## 2026-07-06 — VISUAL FOLLOW-ON item 3: CombatReportPage restyled onto the shared design system

**Done:** `src/features/combat/CombatReportPage.tsx` (`/reports`) now composes the design-system
primitives — `PageHeader` (title/subtitle + `buttonClasses('ghost','sm')` back link, matching the
Dashboard idiom), one `Card` per battle row, `Badge` win/loss pill (`success` won / `danger` lost),
`Notice` for loading/empty (`neutral`) and error (`danger`) callouts, `Button ghost sm` round-log
toggle, and a single local `Fact` helper for the repeated "Label: value" detail lines. Nested round-log
container on the `surface-2`/`edge` layer ramp. Zero raw palette literals remain (grep-verified).

**Presentational-only:** `toggle()` per `encounter_id`, ticks load into `RoundLog` on expand (RoundLog
itself untouched — out of scope), won-detection (`escaped`/`completed`), ships/metal/locName formatters,
`formatDateTime`/`formatDuration`, and loading/empty states all preserved; no `data-testid` existed in
the file. No route, backend, RPC, flag, or `src/components/ui/**` change. `npm run build` (incl.
`tsc -b`) green.

---

## 2026-07-06 — VISUAL FOLLOW-ON item 2: legacy `/map` list view retired (fully superseded by `/galaxy`)

**Decision (human design authority):** the M2-era read-only list browser at `/map` is fully superseded —
`/galaxy` (GalaxyMapScreen) shows the same world data plus the main ship, movements, dock services, stop
controls, and a detail panel covering every metadata field `/map` showed (type/sector/zone/coordinates/
status/difficulty/reward tier/worldstate). Keeping a second, un-modernized map surface is split-brain
debt; clean deletion (like the prior pass's retired legacy UI) over restyling a redundant page.

**Deleted (whole dead-code chain, each importer-verified to zero remaining callers first):**
- `src/features/map/MapPage.tsx` (the `/map` screen)
- `src/features/map/LocationPanel.tsx` (imported ONLY by MapPage)
- `src/game/worldstate/danger.ts` (+ its now-empty `worldstate/` dir) — its only importers were
  MapPage and LocationPanel; its former send-fleet consumer (ExpeditionCommand) was retired 2026-07-05.

**Removed references:** the `/map` route + `MapPage` import in `src/app/App.tsx`; the two "List view"
links (`Dashboard.tsx`, `GalaxyMapScreen.tsx` headers — action rows remain well-formed).

**Kept (still live):** `mapApi.ts` (`fetchWorldMap`/`fetchLocationStates` — used by useGameState,
useGalaxyMapData, CombatReportPage) and `mapTypes.ts` (used across map/dashboard/combat/fleets/portentry).

**Presentational/dead-code removal only:** no backend, RPC, migration, or flag change; `/galaxy`
behavior untouched. Grep confirms zero remaining `src/`+`tests/`+`scripts/` references to `/map`,
`MapPage`, `LocationPanel`, or `worldstate/danger`. `npm run build` (incl. `tsc -b`) green; bundle
579.99 kB → 573.58 kB.

---

## 2026-07-06 — VISUAL FOLLOW-ON item 1: AuthPage restyled onto the shared design system

**Request:** follow-on to the 2026-07-05 visual-modernization pass (item 5) — convert the remaining
un-modernized surfaces, starting with the sign-in/sign-up screen.

**Done:** `src/features/auth/AuthPage.tsx` now composes the design-system primitives per the
`src/components/ui/README.md` rule — `Card`/`CardHeader` panel, `Button` (submit `primary` with
`busy`/`busyLabel`; mode-toggle `ghost sm`), `Notice` (`danger` error / `success` notice), and
token-only input chrome (`bg-surface-2` / `border-edge` / `text-ink` / accent focus, touch-sized
`min-h-11`). Zero raw palette literals remain in the file (grep-verified).

**Presentational-only:** no behavior change — mode toggle, `handleSubmit`, `authStore` signIn/signUp,
signup notice + auto-switch, `navigate('/', { replace: true })`, `busy` disable, `required`/
`minLength={6}` all preserved. No flag, route, RPC, or backend change; `src/components/ui/**` and
`@theme` tokens untouched. `npm run build` green.

---

## 2026-07-05 — UX CLEANUP PASS COMPLETE — final consolidation: full-suite check + PR-ready handoff (no product changes)

**The goal, delivered on `autopilot/20260703-064048` (every slice individually reviewed and passed):**
1. **Legacy UI retired** — TrainShipsPanel / BuildQueuePanel / ExpeditionCommand removed with their whole
   dead-code chain; backend RPCs (`train_units`, `cancel_build_order`, `send_fleet_to_location`) + crons
   intentionally intact, now client-unreferenced.
2. **Honest docking UX** — waypoint-aware Finish-Docking affordance (`at_waypoint`), truthful
   `ineligible_port` copy; server `target_legal` untouched as sole authority (frontend-only).
3. **Consistent in-transit stop** — fleet-domain halt→symmetric-return-home
   (`command_main_ship_stop_transit`, **0149**) + the OSN PortNav stop hardening; ONE shared stop
   UI/controller for all families.
4. **One-word location names** — forward-only data migration **0148** (Refuge/Snare/Reaver/Lull/Blackden
   + Haven/Slagworks/Driftmarch); every caller/test/doc updated same-step; world-map name checks
   field-anchored against the Haven⊂"Outer Haven" substring hazard.
5. **Cohesive visual modernization** — the ONE design system (`@theme` tokens +
   `src/components/ui/` primitives + README rule) across all four most-seen screens: Command Center ·
   Galaxy Map (incl. the elevated map look: deep-space backdrop, semantic markers, legend) · dock/port ·
   market (dark; incidental-styling exception).
6. **On-demand arrival settlement** — both movement families (`command_main_ship_settle_arrival` **0150**;
   `movement_settle_arrival` extraction + `command_main_ship_settle_arrival_legacy` **0151**), cron
   primitives reused verbatim, idempotent by state, unified client due-trigger (~34s → ~an RPC round-trip).

**Migrations 0148–0151: authored, reviewed, NOT applied to any database (the human gate).** No feature
flag was flipped anywhere in the pass; every new capability gates on its domain's EXISTING flag. Nothing
merged or deployed.

**Final full-suite state (this consolidation run; exact counts).**
- `npm run build` — green.
- `verify:m2` — **13/13 PASSED**.
- `verify:m3` — **13/13 PASSED**.
- `verify:m4` — **36/40**: the SAME four pre-existing combat-pacing failures as every run this goal
  (`wave pacing — max 0 ticks/wave` · `damage-no-loss — not observed` · `wave HP decreasing — no
  mid-wave tick found` · `not one-shot — wave HP <= player damage`). Pre-existing/out-of-locked-scope
  (combat/reward correctness untouched; 0148–0151 are additive AND unapplied, so the deployed engine is
  byte-identical to before the goal). **No NEW failure anywhere.**
- `verify:m45` / `verify:m5` — **NOT EXECUTABLE in this environment** (honest report, not a pass claim):
  both hard-require `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, which `.env.local` here deliberately lacks (anon-only),
  and no CI workflow runs the engine suites (they have always run with the human's server-side key).
  **No-regression argument by construction:** m45 exercises `train_units`/`process_build_queue`/
  `cancel_build_order` and m5 exercises `worldstate_tick` — this goal changed NEITHER surface (item 1
  removed only client UI + the browser spec; the m45 NODE engine script is untouched), and the live DB
  the suites run against is unchanged by the goal (all migrations unapplied). Their outcome today is
  therefore identical to before the goal; the human should run both once with their key as part of the
  merge check below.

**REGRESSIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THIS GOAL: NONE** (every runnable suite green or at its documented
pre-existing baseline; the two non-runnable suites are argued unchanged by construction and delegated).

**Human-gated remainder (the explicit handoff):**
1. Run `verify:m45` + `verify:m5` once with the service-role key (pre-merge confirmation).
2. Apply migrations **0148 → 0151** (forward-only, in order) to the database; then re-run the
   DB-dependent proofs that probe-skip today — `verify-mainship-move.mjs` §11 (stop-transit), §12 (OSN
   on-demand settle), §13 (legacy on-demand settle) — and the name-asserting verifiers
   (`postreveal-verify`, `osn-postenable-verify`, catalog verifiers), which expect post-0148 names.
3. Retire the `verify:m2` rename-pair TRANSITIONAL (collapse each old/new name pair to the new name)
   once 0148 is applied to every verified environment — the retirement condition recorded in-line.
4. Visual smoke-check the four converted screens (Command Center, Galaxy Map, dock/port, market — the
   last needs a local-only trade-flag enable to see).
5. Decide the `verify:m4` combat-pacing baseline (out of this goal's locked scope by design).
6. The merge itself.

**Docs.** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` needs NO change in this step (verification + documentation only) —
confirmed. Branch state: **SAFE FOR HUMAN MERGE REVIEW.**

## 2026-07-05 — UX CLEANUP (item 5, slice D) — market surface on the design system (COMPLETES item 5's screen coverage; presentational-only)

**Request.** Final item-5 slice: convert `MarketPanel` + `ShipSwitcher` to the shared tokens/primitives.
Market is DARK behind `trade_market_enabled` (client `TRADE_MARKET_ENABLED` + server rejection), so this
is the allowed incidental-styling application to a dark surface — the flag is NOT flipped; production
stays byte-invisible until the human lights it. No RPC, data flow, gate, buy/sell/selection logic, or
`data-testid` change.

**Converted (the overlay-block idiom; warning tone = the trade identity).**
- `MarketPanel` — token container; wallet/cargo readouts and all prices/quantities on `font-mono
  tabular-nums` (the numeric token); offers table on `edge` borders with `ink-faint` headers; the qty
  input on `surface-2`/`edge` tokens; **Buy → the shared `Button` `success` variant / Sell → `primary`**
  (testids preserved via prop spread; per-row disable while in flight unchanged); row errors
  `text-danger`; the fail-closed unavailable note `ink-faint`. The buy/sell column-naming comment kept
  verbatim.
- `ShipSwitcher` — token container; sole-ship entry as a soft `warning/15` chip; N-ship selection buttons
  (selected `bg-warning text-app`, idle `surface-2` with hover); `ShipMeta` now inherits the entry's text
  color at reduced opacity instead of a fixed gray (correct on both selected and idle backgrounds).

**One shared addition, no duplication:** `Button` gained the `success` variant (token-driven,
`bg-success text-app` + hover step) — added ONCE in `src/components/ui/` for the Buy action; no one-off
styles introduced. (An early draft overrode Button padding per-row; removed — conflicting utilities have
no guaranteed order. Standard `sm` sizing used.)

**Preservation (proof).** `data-testid` counts byte-identical before/after (stash comparison:
MarketPanel 6, ShipSwitcher 4); grep-proven zero old palette literals in both files; all conditional
states/behavior unchanged.

**ITEM 5 SCREEN COVERAGE COMPLETE:** Command Center (A) · Galaxy Map + map-look elevation (B) ·
dock/port (C) · market (D) — all on the ONE design system (`@theme` tokens + `src/components/ui/`).

**Doc-sync.** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` needs NO change — confirmed: presentation only. This entry
added.

**Verify.** `npm run build` green; `tradeReasonMessage` + `mainshipStatusLabel` specs 12/12 (the market
surface's pure-logic suites); `verify:m2`/`verify:m3` unaffected — results in the step report. Visual
drive not possible without a flag change (correctly not made) — build + specs are the machine proof.
SAFE FOR HUMAN MERGE REVIEW.

## 2026-07-05 — UX CLEANUP (item 5, slice C) — dock/port surfaces on the design system (presentational-only)

**Request.** Apply the slice-A tokens/primitives to the dock/port screens: `DockServicesPanel`,
`PortEntryPanel`, `PortNavPanel`. Presentational ONLY — no RPC, data flow, flag, item-2 affordance logic,
stop-control wiring, or `data-testid` change.

**State correction against the slice plan (honest accounting).** `PortEntryPanel` — including the removal
of its duplicated local `CARD` constant in favor of the shared `Card` — was ALREADY fully converted in
slice A (it is mounted on the Command Center, so slice A's "no half-converted screen" rule pulled it in;
that entry records the CARD retirement). Re-verified clean this step (zero old literals; 20 testids
intact). This slice therefore converts the remaining two panels.

**Converted (the compact map-overlay idiom from slice B: token-styled container, primitives for
interactive elements).**
- `DockServicesPanel` — success-toned container (the "safely docked" state), title `text-success`,
  service chips `bg-surface-2 text-ink-muted`, empty-state `ink-faint`. Layout/truncation caps unchanged.
- `PortNavPanel` — accent-toned container (the OSN travel surface); destination list buttons on tokens
  (selected `bg-accent text-app`, idle `bg-surface-2` with hover); the confirm action is now the shared
  `Button` (primary/sm, busy state — testid `port-nav-confirm` preserved via prop spread); error
  `text-danger`; travel line `text-accent`. The item-3 stop mount and the destName-gated label are
  untouched.

**No new primitive was needed** — `Button`/`Notice`/`Card` from slices A/B cover these panels; the
semantic tokens replace every raw rose/amber/emerald/sky literal.

**Preservation (proof).** `data-testid` counts byte-identical before/after (stash comparison:
DockServicesPanel 5, PortNavPanel 6, PortEntryPanel 20); all conditional states/behavior unchanged;
grep-proven zero old palette literals across the three panels. Only the MARKET slice (MarketPanel +
ShipSwitcher, dark behind `trade_market_enabled`) remains for item 5.

**Doc-sync.** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` needs NO change — confirmed: presentation only. This entry
added.

**Verify.** `npm run build` green; `verify:portentry` 32/32 (drives PortEntryPanel's affordance logic);
`verify:osn:port` 25/25 (readiness + port-move logic) and `verify:osn:osn4` 9/9 (stop surface) as
regression; `verify:m2`/`verify:m3` unaffected — results in the step report. SAFE FOR HUMAN MERGE REVIEW.

## 2026-07-05 — UX CLEANUP (item 5, slice B) — Galaxy Map on the design system + map-look elevation (presentational-only)

**Request.** Apply the slice-A tokens/primitives to the Galaxy Map (the goal's explicit "improve the
galaxy-map look") — no new palette, no parallel styling system; presentational ONLY (no RPC, data flow,
flag, movement/selection logic, or `data-testid` change).

**Screen chrome → primitives/tokens.** `GalaxyMapScreen` (header nav → `buttonClasses`, states/aside/
overlay bar → tokens), `MainShipPreview` (Card/Badge/Notice/Button — recall stays disabled-gated),
`MainShipCommand` (Button/Notice/SectionLabel; confirm/cancel flow identical), `SpaceStopControls`
(warning-toned surface + the shared warning Button). `Button` gained ONE size, `icon` (square), consumed
by the map's zoom cluster — no other primitive additions were needed.

**Map canvas elevation (all token-driven — SVG consumes the same @theme tokens via `var(--color-*)`,
which Tailwind v4 emits as `:root` custom properties; NO new tokens were needed).**
- Backdrop: subtle deep-space radial glow (`surface`→`app`) + a faint `edge` grid pattern — replaces the
  flat hex fill; the container wears the standard `rounded-card border-edge shadow-card` chrome.
- Location markers (`LocationMarker`): semantic identity — hostile (`pirate_hunt`/`pirate_den`) →
  `danger`, safe (`safe_zone`) → `success`, dockable port (`trade_outpost`) → `accent` **plus a second
  "hub" ring** so ports read differently from waypoints at any zoom; resource/event → `warning`;
  derelict → muted. Each node: soft always-on identity halo + core dot + app-colored stroke; NEW
  hover halo (`group-hover`) and a solid selected ring; labels carry an app-colored paint-order halo for
  legibility over the grid.
- Routes: `FleetMovementLine` outbound → `warning`, return → `accent` (ETA labels haloed);
  `SpaceRouteLine` outbound token + haloed ETA. In-transit emphasis is consistent across both families.
- Main-ship marker: state-toned chevron (outbound `warning` / returning `accent` / settled `success`)
  inside an always-accent "this is YOU" halo ring — the player reads distinctly at any zoom. Home base
  diamond + label → accent tokens.
- NEW compact legend (bottom-left, pointer-inert) mirroring the marker semantics exactly: safe · hostile
  · port · home, merged with the existing hint line.

**Behavior/structure preserved (proof).** SVG coordinate math, camera, gesture/selection handlers, and
every flag-gated mount untouched; `data-testid` counts byte-identical before/after per file (stash
comparison: GalaxyMapScreen 5, LocationMarker 1, MainShipMarker 1, FleetMovementLine 1, SpaceRouteLine 2,
SpaceStopControls 4, MainShipPreview 7, MainShipCommand 11). Grep-proven ZERO old palette/hex literals in
any converted map file. The only spec-pinned visual attributes (`fill="none"` on the S6C crosshair + dev
preview) are untouched. PortNavPanel / DockServicesPanel / MarketPanel / the dark activity panels stay on
their current styling — the dock/port and market slices remain next.

**Doc-sync.** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` needs NO change — confirmed: presentation only, no
table/writer/flag/RPC/edge. This entry added.

**Verify.** `npm run build` green; ALL map-related unit specs green — 129/129 across
spaceRouteModel/spaceRouteLine/galaxyShipLayer/spaceStopCommand/resolveMainShipMarker/spaceMoveTarget/
galaxyCamera/mainshipStatusLabel/devFixedSpacePreview/openSpaceTransform; `verify:m2`/`verify:m3`
unaffected (results in the step report). SAFE FOR HUMAN MERGE REVIEW.

## 2026-07-05 — UX CLEANUP (item 5, slice A) — the ONE shared design system + Command Center conversion (presentational-only)

**Request.** Final goal item, foundation slice: establish the single source of truth for styling (tokens +
primitives) and prove it by fully converting the first real screen — the Command Center. Presentational
ONLY: no RPC call, data flow, flag, migration, or `data-testid` changed; other screens untouched (they
keep the default Tailwind palette until their slices).

**Tokens (`src/index.css` `@theme` — Tailwind v4; the canonical source, documented in-line).** Deep-space
dark: color layers `app` (#0b1120, near-black blue — never pure black) < `surface` (#131c31) <
`surface-2` (#1c2742) + border `edge`; text `ink` / `ink-muted` / `ink-faint` (AA on the surfaces); ONE
interactive accent (sky #38bdf8) + semantic `success`/`warning`/`danger` (light-400 weights, AA on dark;
each with a `-hover` step so filled buttons run dark-text-on-bright-fill at ~8:1); `--font-sans` (system
stack) + `--font-mono` (numeric readouts); `--radius-card` (1rem) + `--shadow-card` (soft elevation +
hairline top highlight). Type conventions recorded (page `text-2xl semibold`, panel `text-lg semibold`,
body `sm`, metadata `xs`, micro-labels via SectionLabel). `body` now consumes the tokens (the old
hardcoded `#070b16`/`#e6ecff` removed).

**Primitives (`src/components/ui/` + barrel + README — "screens compose primitives, never re-define
styles").** Built ONLY what the Command Center consumes (no speculative components):
`Button` (primary/secondary/ghost/danger/warning · sm/md · busy/busyLabel; `buttonClasses()` for router
Links), `Card`/`CardHeader` (the panel treatment; `tone` prop for feature identity tints; spreads
data-testid/aria), `Badge` (semantic status pill), `Meter` (progress/integrity bar), `Notice` (inline
tinted callout), `SectionLabel`, `PageHeader`. README documents tokens, primitives, conventions, and the
single-source rule.

**Command Center fully converted (no half-old/half-new).** `Dashboard.tsx` (PageHeader + buttonClasses
nav + Notice error), `BasePanel`, `ExpeditionLauncher`, `MainShipPanel` (Badge status, Notice warnings,
warning-variant Repair, Meter progress), `FleetStatusPanel` (STATUS_STYLE class map → semantic
`STATUS_TONE` Badge map), `ActiveCombatPanel` (danger-tone Card; its local Bar now wraps the shared
Meter) + its children `CombatEventLayer`/`RoundLog` (token swap), `CombatReportsView`,
`PortEntryPanel` (the local `CARD` const retired for the Card primitive), and the dark `RankingPanel`
(incidental token pass — the locked-scope dark-feature styling exception; renders null in production
regardless). Grep-proven: ZERO old palette literals (`white/*`, `slate-*`, `indigo-*`, `emerald-*`,
`amber-*`, `rose-*`, `red-*`, `sky-*`) remain in any converted file; every `data-testid` preserved
(counts re-checked per file); element roles preserved (panels stay `<section>` via Card; the PortEntry
affordance wrappers keep their outer `<div data-testid="port-entry-panel">`).

**Next slices.** Galaxy map screen, dock/port surfaces, market — each converts to the same primitives;
add primitives only as those screens need them.

**Doc-sync.** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` needs NO change — confirmed: no table, writer, flag, RPC, or
cross-system edge changed; this is client presentation only. This entry added.

**Verify.** `npm run build` green; `verify:portentry` (drives the PortEntryPanel affordance logic)
green; `verify:m2`/`verify:m3` unaffected (backend suites) — results in the step report. SAFE FOR HUMAN
MERGE REVIEW.

## 2026-07-05 — UX CLEANUP — reconcile the stale `verify:m2` world-count pin (test-only; suite green again, 13/13)

**Request.** `verify:m2` had been red (10/11) since the goal started: its "exactly 5 locations" pin
predates the 3 starter ports (0066) and the human's production reveal. Test-only reconciliation — no
migration, seed, or product code touched; `verify:m3/m4/m45/m5` untouched. No `SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES` change
(no table/writer/system change).

**What the pin now asserts (strict — never a loose count).** `scripts/verify-m2.mjs` runs against the
LIVE DB via `get_world_map()` (ACTIVE locations only), so the correct world shape is: the 5 waypoints
(0002 — Refuge/Lull `safe_zone`, Snare/Reaver/Blackden `pirate_hunt`) always present with exact
names+types; the 3 starter ports (0066 — Haven/Slagworks/Driftmarch `trade_outpost`) as an
ALL-OR-NOTHING set (0 pre-reveal on a fresh seed, 3 post-reveal — the production state; a partial set
always fails); total count = exactly 5 + revealed ports (no strays); type totals (3 pirate_hunt +
2 safe_zone + N trade_outpost).

**TRANSITIONAL rename-pair matching (in-line note + retirement condition).** The first green run exposed
that production is post-REVEAL but pre-0148 (the item-4 rename is human-applied and still pending), so
pinning only the new names would keep m2 red until 0148 lands — and pinning old names would re-drift the
moment it does. Each location is therefore matched under EXACTLY one of its two known names (the 0002/0066
seed name OR the 0148 one-word rename) with the type pinned; the output labels which era it saw.
**Retirement:** collapse each pair to the new name only, once the human applies 0148 to every verified
environment.

**Verify.** `verify:m2` **13/13 PASSED** (live output labeled "pre-0148 seed names", 8 locations = 5
waypoints + 3 revealed ports); `npm run build` green (nothing else moved).

**`verify:m4` 36/40 baseline confirmed genuinely pre-existing (no action — combat correctness is out of
locked scope).** The same four failures on every run this goal (steps 6, 8): `wave pacing — max 0
ticks/wave` · `damage-no-loss — not observed` · `wave HP decreasing — no mid-wave tick found` · `not
one-shot — wave HP <= player damage`. Rationale: all four are combat-PACING observations against the live
engine; no slice in this goal modified combat/reward code — the branch's only server-side artifacts are
the additive, UNAPPLIED migrations 0148–0151 (rename data + stop/settle functions), so the deployed combat
path is byte-identical to before this goal. The drift is live-environment tuning that predates the branch.

## 2026-07-05 — UX CLEANUP (item 6, part B) — on-demand LEGACY main-ship arrival settlement (migration 0151: helper extraction + RPC + unified client due-trigger)

**Request.** The legacy first-trip arrival (MainShipCommand home→port/waypoint, and every return leg)
still waits up to ~30s of `process-fleet-movements` cron (0011) + a 3–4s poll. Highest-risk slice (it
touches the core legacy movement cron): extract the cron's per-movement settle into ONE shared helper both
the cron and a new narrow RPC call — no second settlement copy, combat path untouched, spine proven green.

**Internals confirmed first (citations).** The CURRENT `process_fleet_movements` body is **0096** (NOT
0030 — 0096 re-created it for the activity-agnostic `reward_source_type` deposit): due scan
`status='moving' and arrive_at<=now()` **FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED** (movement rows first, fleets updated
after) → per-row: location target → arrived + `fleet_set_present` + `presence_create(activity)` (combat
init is NOT a cron branch — it lives downstream in `activity_start`, 0008:52/0018, which routes
`hunt_pirates` → Combat); base target → arrived + unit merge + `fleet_complete` (requires
`status='returning'`, 0006:163) + reward deposit ONLY when payload non-empty AND source set; unknown →
failed. Main-ship legacy movements can never reach the combat/reward parts: sends hard-reject non-'none'
targets (0050:104/0053:71), the fleets carry zero units, and payload stays '{}'. Main-ship predicate =
`fleets.main_ship_id is not null` (0050:185-187); gate = `mainship_send_enabled` (0050:73/0053:34).

**Migration `20260618000151_legacy_settle_arrival_on_demand.sql` (3 parts).**
1. **`movement_settle_arrival(p_movement)`** (internal; revoked from all client roles) — THE extracted
   per-movement settle: the verbatim 0096 loop body behind a guarded locked re-read
   (`status='moving' AND arrive_at<=now()` FOR UPDATE — a no-op re-take for the cron, which already holds
   the lock on a row it proved due (now() is txn-constant); the authoritative claim for the RPC).
2. **`process_fleet_movements()` re-created** — the scan/locks/count are UNCHANGED; the loop body is now
   exactly `perform movement_settle_arrival(m.id)`. **Byte-equivalent:** identical writes in identical
   order, including `presence_create(activity)` (hunt arrivals still enter Combat exactly as before) and
   the 0096 reward deposit. The combat-triggering path is untouched by construction — it was never a cron
   branch to begin with.
3. **`command_main_ship_settle_arrival_legacy(p_fleet default null)`** (SECURITY DEFINER,
   `search_path=public`; revoke public/anon, grant authenticated) — gate `mainship_send_enabled` (no new
   flag, no flip) → resolve the fleet (explicit owned id, or the sole in-flight main-ship fleet;
   fail-closed `ambiguous_fleet` otherwise) → main-ship-only → claim the movement FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
   (the cron's own lock order ⇒ no deadlock either direction; contention → `{settled:false,
   reason:'busy'}`, the cron wins, never blocks) → `not_due` when early → **NON-COMBAT SCOPING:** refuses
   any `activity_type<>'none'` location target (`combat_target_unsupported`) so the on-demand path can
   NEVER drive combat init (defense-in-depth over the structural unreachability) → settle via the SAME
   helper. Idempotent by state (no receipts — settling grants nothing): the helper's guard makes a
   cron-vs-RPC race exactly-once; the loser no-ops `already_settled`. NOT applied to any DB.

**Client (ONE due-trigger for both families — no second loop, no cadence changes).**
`useSettleDueArrival` refactored around a shared inner `useDueTimer` (one timer at `arrive_at`+150ms, one
fire per movement id, primitive-field deps so polls never reschedule) and now takes the optional
`legacyMovement`/`legacyFleetId` pair alongside the OSN movement — part A behavior byte-identical.
`settleArrival.ts` gains `LEGACY_SETTLE_ARRIVAL_RPC` and the legacy outcomes
(`present`/`completed`/`failed`) in the shared fail-closed parser;
`mainshipApi.commandMainShipSettleArrivalLegacy` is the thin wrapper. Wired in `GalaxyMapScreen` (reuses
the item-3 `legacyMove`) AND in `Dashboard` (the first-trip player waits at the Command Center's
MainShipPanel countdown; routes are exclusive so only one hook instance is ever mounted; OSN part stays
inert there).

**Tests.** `tests/settleArrival.spec.ts` extended (legacy RPC pin + legacy outcomes in the parser truth
table). `scripts/verify-mainship-move.mjs` §13 (same harness, probe-SKIPs until 0151 is applied): not-due
no-op → due outbound arrival settles ON DEMAND to `present` at the destination (cron race tolerated as
`already_settled` — still exactly-once) → repeat no-op → due `return_home` settles to `completed` at home
→ a non-main-ship (combat-target) unit fleet is REFUSED (`not_main_ship_fleet`).

**Doc-sync.** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`: the §2 Movement row gains `movement_settle_arrival` (the ONE
settlement body, both callers) + `command_main_ship_settle_arrival_legacy` (full guards), and §3 gains the
RPC's flow entry + the cron note — Movement remains the SOLE writer of `fleet_movements`, no new table,
call graph unchanged/acyclic. This entry added.

**Verify (real runs — spine regression proof).** `npm run build` green; `verify:osn:settle` green;
`verify:m3` **must stay 13/13** and `verify:m4` **must show no new failures vs the recorded 36/40
baseline** (failing names before: wave pacing · damage-no-loss · wave HP decreasing · not one-shot) —
results recorded in the step report. Honest scope note: the live DB does not include 0151 (human gate), so
live m3/m4 exercise the deployed cron unchanged; the extraction's equivalence is proven by the verbatim
code diff above and asserted end-to-end by §13 the moment the human applies 0151. SAFE FOR HUMAN MERGE
REVIEW.

## 2026-07-05 — UX CLEANUP (item 6, part A) — on-demand OSN arrival settlement (migration 0150 + client due-trigger)

**Request.** Per the diagnosis §C: a due OSN movement waits up to ~30s of
`process-mainship-space-arrivals` cron (0058:129) plus a 3–4s poll before the player sees the ship settle
(~34s worst case, ship visibly floating "arrived but not settled"). Add a server-authoritative, idempotent
on-demand settle that reuses the cron's exact primitives — no duplicated settlement body, no cron/poll
cadence changes.

**Internals confirmed first (citations).** Current processor body = 0064:95-178: non-locking due scan
(112-118) → SKIP-LOCKED ship claim via `mainship_space_lock_context(ship, true)` (120; 0056:37-44 returns
'skipped' on contention) → coherent `in_transit` validate (126-131) → cross-domain exclusion (134-139) →
movement re-read under lock, still `status='moving'` AND due, + full fleet-linkage check (142-160) →
primitives: `target_kind='location'` → `mainship_space_dock_at_location` (0061; current body 0067 §E1 —
returns docked:true, or docked:false = deterministic TERMINAL settlement) else
`mainship_space_settle_space_arrival` with ONE captured timestamp (0064:43-92). Both primitives guard
every write with `… and status='moving'`. Ownership resolution incl. sole-ship shim =
`mainship_resolve_owned_ship` (0081:26-54). Every OSN command gates on
`mainship_space_movement_enabled` (0083:127). OSN travel time uses the same `travel_scale` /
`min_travel_seconds` config as legacy (0067 core).

**Migration `20260618000150_osn_settle_arrival_on_demand.sql`** — ONE authenticated RPC
`command_main_ship_settle_arrival(p_main_ship_id default null)` (SECURITY DEFINER, `search_path=public`;
revoke public/anon, grant authenticated). Gate = the SAME existing `mainship_space_movement_enabled` (no
new flag, no flip; dark envs reject `feature_disabled` before any read). Body mirrors the cron's claim
sequence VERBATIM for the caller's own ship, then invokes the cron's OWN primitives — zero settlement
logic duplicated. **Idempotent/race-safe by state, no receipts** (settling grants nothing — it advances an
inevitable transition): SKIP-LOCKED claim → contention returns `{settled:false, reason:'busy'}` (the cron
wins, never blocks); the primitives' `status='moving'` guards make a cron/on-demand race exactly-once
(loser observes not-moving → `already_settled`); not-due → `not_due` no-op; settled/idle ship →
`already_settled`/`no_active_movement`; any linkage mismatch → frozen-failure `incoherent_state`, touching
nothing. **No reward/spend re-entry exists**: OSN settlement writes only movement/fleet/ship/presence
state (rewards ride LEGACY fleet_movements only). The cron stays UNCHANGED at 30s as the backstop. NOT
applied to any DB.

**Client due-trigger (no new poll loop, no interval changes).** `settleArrival.ts` (pure): RPC literal,
fail-closed envelope parser, `computeSettleDelayMs` (0 when due; exact remaining delay otherwise; null =
nothing to schedule — the cron backstops). `useSettleDueArrival` (hook): arms ONE timer at `arrive_at`
(+150ms so the server-side due check is already true), fires the RPC ONCE per movement id (ref-guard, the
existing stop/recall idiom), then `refresh()`; effect deps are the movement's PRIMITIVE fields so the 3–4s
polls never reschedule it. Wired in `GalaxyMapScreen` (where the OSN movement is already in scope);
`mainshipApi.commandMainShipSettleArrival` is the thin §2.5 wrapper. Perceived settle latency drops from
~34s worst case to roughly the RPC round-trip after `arrive_at`.

**Tests.** `tests/settleArrival.spec.ts` (+ `verify:osn:settle` script): RPC-name pin, envelope parsing
(all settled outcomes / all no-op reasons / rejection passthrough / malformed fails closed — never a
fabricated settlement), and the due-trigger timing truth table. `scripts/verify-mainship-move.mjs` §12
(same harness, probe-SKIPs until 0150 is applied): not-due no-op → due location move settles ON DEMAND
(docks; cron-race tolerated as `already_settled` — still exactly-once) → ship canonically `at_location` →
repeat call `already_settled` → due SPACE move settles `arrived`/`in_space`. Flag handling in §12 follows
the script's established capture/restore pattern (send flag precedent); the DARK
`mainship_coordinate_travel_enabled` gate is restored within ~a second of issuing the one test move —
possible because that flag gates INITIATION only (settlement is flag-independent, the OSN-4 in-flight
principle). Note: §12 runs only when the human applies 0150 and executes the script.

**Doc-sync.** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`: new "On-demand OSN arrival settle" blockquote (the doc's
established OSN-note idiom, beside the geometry/settled-safe leaf notes) — no new writer, no new table,
call graph unchanged/acyclic. This entry added.

**Verify (real runs).** `npm run build` green; `verify:osn:settle` green; `verify:m3` green — results in
the step report. SAFE FOR HUMAN MERGE REVIEW.

## 2026-07-05 — UX CLEANUP (item 3) — consistent in-transit "stop" for LEGACY main-ship moves (migration 0149 + shared stop UI reuse)

**Request.** Per the movement→arrival→dock diagnosis: the stop system existed only in the OSN
`main_ship_space_movements` domain, while every visible send (`send_main_ship_expedition` 0050 /
`move_main_ship_to_location` 0053 — the `MainShipCommand` surface) creates LEGACY `fleet_movements` with NO
halt capability at all (`request_main_ship_return` requires `status='present'`, 0050:189). Design decision
(human): a legacy in-transit stop is a Fleet/Movement-domain **halt → return-home** with a **symmetric
turnaround** (arrives home after the time already spent outbound) — never a new "hold in space" state (that
is OSN's concept; recreating it in legacy would be a parallel movement system).

**Movement internals confirmed first (citations).** `fleet_movements` 0007:9-52 (status
moving/arrived/cancelled/failed; `mission_type` incl. `return_home`; `one_active_movement_per_fleet`
partial unique; `arrive_at > depart_at`); `movement_create` 0007:68-125; the cron `process_fleet_movements`
0030:36-83 claims due rows `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` (movement row FIRST, fleets updated after) and its
base-arrival branch calls `fleet_complete`, which REQUIRES `status='returning'` (0006:163) — so a halt must
also step the fleet moving→returning; the generic state machine has no such edge (0053:92-102 is the exact
precedent: a dedicated, main-ship-scoped inline transition for its missing present→moving edge). The
visible send is gated on `mainship_send_enabled` (0050:73, 0053:34).

**Migration `20260618000149_mainship_stop_transit.sql`** — ONE new authenticated RPC
`command_main_ship_stop_transit(p_fleet)` (SECURITY DEFINER, `search_path=public`; revoke public/anon,
grant authenticated). Gate = the SAME existing `mainship_send_enabled` (no new flag, no flip — dark envs
reject `feature_disabled`; the human's live env gets it). Validates owned + main-ship fleet (the 0050
return predicate), then claims the active movement `FOR UPDATE` in the cron's own lock order and:
- **outbound + not due** → transforms the SAME row in place to the `return_home` shape
  `request_main_ship_return` produces (target = origin base; `depart_at=now`,
  `arrive_at = now + elapsed-outbound` floored at 1s; `origin_x/y` = the interpolated halt point so the map
  shows the ship turning around in place; origin entity ids keep the halted destination as provenance;
  `travel_seconds` is the design-fixed symmetric time — documented in the header; `speed_used` unchanged),
  steps the fleet moving→returning (dedicated scoped edge, 0053 idiom) and the ship to 'returning'
  (0050:223 idiom). The one-active-movement invariant holds by construction (no second row) and the
  transformed row is settled by the NORMAL `process_fleet_movements` return branch — one settlement path.
- **idempotent no-ops by state** (no receipts — a stop grants nothing): cron settled first / no transit →
  `{ok:true, stopped:false, reason:'already_settled'}`; already `return_home` → `'already_returning'`;
  due-but-unsettled → `'arrived'` (LEFT for the cron). Every mutation is guarded `status='moving'` under
  the row lock; same lock order as the cron ⇒ no deadlock, SKIP LOCKED ⇒ the cron never blocks on us.
- **No reward interaction possible:** main-ship targets are `activity_type='none'` (0050:104/0053:71) so no
  combat ever attaches cargo; `reward_payload_json` stays `'{}'` and the deposit branch (0030:70-72)
  requires a non-empty payload — double-reward is structurally unreachable. NOT applied to any DB.

**Client (reuse, no parallel stop system).** `spaceStopCommand.ts`: `STOP_TRANSIT_RPC`,
`isActiveLegacyOutboundTransit` (fleet 'moving' + non-return mission), and `parseStopTransitResult` mapping
the server envelope onto the SHARED `SpaceStopResult` (halt→'stopped'; every no-op→'arrived').
`mainshipApi.commandMainShipStopTransit(fleetId)` (thin wrapper, the 0064 idiom).
`useLegacyStopTransitCommand` (sibling of `useSpaceStopCommand`, SAME `createSpaceStopController` — only
the wired RPC differs; recreated per in-transit fleet). `SpaceStopControls` gained optional copy props
(defaults = the original OSN strings byte-for-byte) so the ONE component also serves
"Main ship in transit / Stop — return home / Turning around — returning home." — mounted in
`GalaxyMapScreen` beside the other overlays (renders only for an outbound legacy transit of the main-ship
fleet; refreshes after the command settles; mutually exclusive with the OSN stop mounts by
one-movement-owner state). **PortNav hardening (diagnosis follow-through):** `PortNavPanel` now renders the
OSN stop for ANY location-target transit; only the destination NAME stays behind the visible-map check
(fail-closed — no name/id/coord leak).

**Tests.** `tests/spaceStopCommand.spec.ts` extended (same harness): RPC-name pin, the legacy-transit
predicate truth table, and the envelope mapping (halt / all three no-op reasons / rejection passthrough +
copy fallback / malformed fails closed). `scripts/verify-mainship-move.mjs` extended with section 11
(fresh user: mid-flight stop → in-place `return_home` transform + fleet/ship 'returning' + symmetric
timing bound; duplicate stop → `already_returning`; normal-path completion; post-arrival stop →
`already_settled`), behind a loud DEPLOYMENT PROBE that SKIPs when `command_main_ship_stop_transit` is not
yet in the target DB — so the suite stays green before AND after the human applies 0149.

**Doc-sync.** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`: the §2 Movement row gains `command_main_ship_stop_transit`
(full semantics + guards) and §3 gains its flow entry — Movement remains the SOLE writer of
`fleet_movements`, no new table, call graph unchanged/acyclic. This entry added.

**Verify (recorded honestly — real runs).** `npm run build` green. `verify:osn:osn4` (the extended stop
spec) **9/9 green**. Live DB: `verify:m3` **13/13 PASSED** (movement spine unaffected — 0149 is additive
and NOT applied). `verify:m4` **36/40**: the 4 failures are combat PACING/TUNING assertions (wave pacing,
damage-no-loss, mid-wave HP ticks, not-one-shot) — **PRE-EXISTING live-environment balance drift**,
provably unrelated to this commit (zero server-side change is applied by it; the client diff cannot touch
a server-driving node script). Same class as the `verify:m2` "5 locations" pin already on record — flagged
for the human alongside it. Section 11 of `verify-mainship-move.mjs` SKIPs live until 0149 is applied
(by design; the probe prints the skip loudly). SAFE FOR HUMAN MERGE REVIEW.

## 2026-07-05 — UX CLEANUP (item 2) — honest docking UX at non-dock waypoints (frontend-only; server eligibility untouched)

**Request.** Fix the misleading docking rejection per the movement→arrival→dock diagnosis: a
dockability-blind "Finish Docking" affordance was offered for ANY legacy-present ship, so arriving at a
non-dock waypoint (Refuge, Lull) offered docking, the click hit `normalize_main_ship_dock` →
`mainship_space_location_target_legal` failing at `target_unsupported_role` (0067:89 — waypoints are
`physical_role='unclassified'`), and 0084 collapsed that to blanket `ineligible_port`, rendered as the red
*"This port is not accepting docking right now."* Revealed real ports dock fine (OSN arrivals dock
directly via Dock-0; legacy port arrivals pass target_legal) — the defect was purely the player-facing
surface.

**Fix (frontend-only; NO migration, RPC, eligibility, flag, or reveal change).**
- `src/features/map/mapTypes.ts` — `isDockablePortForDisplay(locationType)`: the ONE client classifier
  (dockable port ⇔ `location_type==='trade_outpost'`; waypoints are `safe_zone`/`pirate_hunt`).
  **Authority/retirement note (also in-line):** this is a DISPLAY heuristic exploiting the seed's clean
  `location_type` ↔ dockability coupling (0066: role city/port + active docking service ⇔ trade_outpost);
  server `target_legal` remains the sole enforcement authority (UI fails closed — a wrong guess still gets
  the server rejection). If that coupling ever changes (a non-dockable trade_outpost, or dockability
  exposed via get_world_map), update/retire THIS function; the literal is deliberately not scattered.
- `src/features/portentry/portEntryApi.ts` — `PortEntryShipState.presentLocationId` from
  `fleets.current_location_id` on the ALREADY-fetched active-fleet row (zero new reads).
- `src/features/portentry/portEntry.ts` — new read-only affordance `{kind:'at_waypoint', locationName}`:
  a coherent legacy-present ship at a location classified NON-dockable gets an honest explanation instead
  of the doomed Finish-Docking button; `resolvePresentLocation(state, locations)` resolves the location
  from the threaded world map. UNKNOWN location (map not loaded / id not visible) deliberately keeps the
  pre-existing `'normalize'` behavior — a classification gap can only show the old button (server still
  rejects), never hide docking at a real port. Finish Docking at dockable ports is byte-identical.
  Reworded `ineligible_port` copy (the fail-closed fallback for a display/server disagreement):
  *"You can't dock here — this location has no docking service."* — never claims a "port".
- `src/features/portentry/usePortEntry.ts` + `PortEntryPanel.tsx` — optional `locations` threading (the
  parent's already-polled `get_world_map` list; no new fetch) + the `at_waypoint` card (reuses the
  existing `CARD` idiom; port names in the hint are DERIVED via the same classifier — no hardcoded names).
- `src/features/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx` — passes `game.locations` (already in scope from useGameState).

**Tests (tests/portEntry.spec.ts).** New: legacy-present at waypoint → `at_waypoint` (NOT normalize);
legacy-present at dockable port → still `normalize`; unknown location / no map → pre-existing `normalize`
fallback; classifier truth table; `ineligible_port` copy asserted to never say "not accepting" and to name
the real cause. Existing affordance/parser/controller tests unchanged (fixture gains
`presentLocationId: null`).

**Doc-sync.** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` needs NO change — confirmed: no table, writer, flag, RPC, or
cross-system edge changed; this is client display logic over existing owner-reads.

**Verify.** `npm run build` green; `verify:portentry` (pure-logic unit spec, no DB) green — results in the
step report. SAFE FOR HUMAN MERGE REVIEW.

## 2026-07-05 — UX CLEANUP (item 4) — one-word location names (forward-only data migration 0148 + every caller updated same step)

**Request.** Player-facing UX/cleanup pass, slice 2: rename every seeded location to a single evocative,
unique word (display data only), via ONE forward-only migration, keeping every name-referencing script,
test, and doc consistent in the same step.

**The mapping (all 8 seeded locations — 0002 waypoints by unique (zone_id, name) key, 0066 ports by fixed UUID).**
| old | new | key |
|---|---|---|
| Safe Rally Point | **Refuge** | Wreck Belt waypoint |
| Pirate Ambush Point | **Snare** | Wreck Belt waypoint |
| Raider Outpost | **Reaver** | Wreck Belt waypoint |
| Quiet Drift | **Lull** | Ion Storm Route waypoint |
| Pirate Den | **Blackden** | Ion Storm Route waypoint |
| Haven Reach | **Haven** | `b1a00001-0066-…-000000000001` |
| Slagworks Anchorage | **Slagworks** | `b1a00002-0066-…-000000000002` |
| Driftmarch Waypost | **Driftmarch** | `b1a00003-0066-…-000000000003` |

**Migration `20260618000148_location_names_single_word.sql`** — data-only, forward-only (0002/0066 NOT
edited; 0066 documents `name` as mutable display data — every functional lookup is UUID-keyed). One atomic
fail-closed do-block: ports updated by fixed UUID, waypoints by zone-scoped current name; aborts with no
partial rename if any row is missing, any old name survives, or ANY location keeps a multi-word name.
Idempotent re-run tolerated. unique(zone_id, name) holds (new names distinct per zone). **NOT applied to
any database** — the human applies it; the reveal gate (`reveal_starter_ports`, human-gated) is untouched.

**Every caller updated (grep-proven; the substring hazard is the real finding).** The new port name
`Haven` is a SUBSTRING of the sector name `Outer Haven`, so every world-map presence/absence text check
was converted from bare-word matching to FIELD-ANCHORED matching (`"name" *: *"Haven"` against
`get_world_map()::text`, which is jsonb): `postreveal-verify.sql` (MAP_PORT_NAMES),
`osn-hub1a-production-catalog-verify.sql` + `worldhub1b-a-production-catalog-verify.sh` (MAP_LEAK),
`portlaunch2b-realchain-fixtures.sql` (pre-reveal absence + post-reveal presence),
`worldhub1b-a-realchain-proof.sql` (hidden-leak check). Other updates:
- **src (player-facing copy):** `portEntryCommand.ts` commission success copy, `PortEntryPanel.tsx` claim
  copy → "Haven". (Recon note correction: these two hardcoded strings existed after all.)
- **tests:** `portEntry.spec.ts` (asserts the copy), plus fixtures in `dockServicesUi.uispec.ts`,
  `mainshipStatusLabel.spec.ts`, `osnPortNavUi.uispec.ts` → new names.
- **scripts:** name literals/labels/comments in `osn-enablement-1b-journey.sh`,
  `portlaunch1a-realchain-concurrency.sh`, `port-entry-1-proof.sh/.sql`,
  `reveal-starter-ports-operation.sql`, `trade-economy-bootstrap-proof.sql`, `trade-fleet-0c-proof.sql`,
  `trade-market-1-proof.sql`, `postreveal-verify.sh/.sql`, `osn-postenable-verify.sh/.sql`,
  `portlaunch2b-realchain-fixtures.sql`, `worldhub1b-a-realchain-proof.sql` (incl. its
  `name='Haven Reach'`→`'Haven'` functional lookup and expected-VALUES rows),
  `osn-hub1a-production-catalog-verify.sql`, `worldhub1b-a-production-catalog-verify.sh` (P*_NAME).
- **Self-binding catalog verifiers kept coherent:** `worldhub1b-a-production-catalog-verify.sh` and
  `osn-hub1a-production-catalog-verify.sh` grep their expected literals from the checked-out migrations
  ("derived-from-migration"). The 0066 grep lists KEEP the old seed names (they verify the historical
  file's verbatim content); the CURRENT display names now bind to `0148` (new `MIG148` greps added), and
  the live-DB assertions use the new names.
- **workflows (dispatch-only; nothing dispatched):** name mentions in comments/messages of
  `osn3-anchor1b-realchain-proof.yml`, `portlaunch2b-realchain-proof.yml` (all UUID-keyed functionally).
- **docs (current-fact, dated per the established idiom):** `README.md` "Current status" port line
  (renamed + dated note), `REVEAL_STARTER_PORTS_RUNBOOK.md` (table + dated note),
  `BYEHARU_PROJECT_GUIDE.md` (dated parenthetical), `TRADE_FLEET_0A_IMPACT_AUDIT.md` (illustrative
  example). *(Review fix 2026-07-05: README was initially missed because the sweep grep listed
  `src/ scripts/ tests/ docs/ .github/` and never the REPO ROOT — the re-run sweep below greps the whole
  tree from `.` so root-level files can no longer escape.)*
- **Intentionally NOT touched (reported):** shipped migrations 0002/0066/0068/0072/0077/0078/0080/0085
  (forward-only; their old-name mentions are comments/exception text — functional lookups are UUID-keyed)
  and DEV_LOG history.
- **Whole-tree post-sweep (from repo root, excluding only node_modules/dist/.git/test artifacts,
  git-ignored `*.local.md`, DEV_LOG history, and the shipped 2026-06 migrations):** exactly FOUR old-name
  mentions survive, all intentional — the two dated "formerly …" annotations themselves (`README.md`,
  `REVEAL_STARTER_PORTS_RUNBOOK.md`) and the two `osn-hub1a-production-catalog-verify.sh` lines that grep
  the HISTORICAL 0066 migration file for its verbatim seed literals.

**Ordering note for the human.** The updated name-asserting verifiers (`postreveal-verify`,
`osn-postenable-verify`, the catalog verifiers) expect the POST-0148 names — apply 0148 before
dispatching them; until then they would report the old names (and vice versa the pre-edit scripts would
break after 0148). Same-step atomicity is the point: migration + all callers ship together.

**Engine verify scripts are name-INDEPENDENT (grep-proven).** `verify-m2/m3/m4/m45/m5` select locations
by `location_type` (`safe_zone` / `pirate_hunt`) and UUIDs — zero name references — so they stay green on
both sides of 0148 by construction. `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` needs NO change: no table, writer, flag,
or cross-system edge changed (it contains no location names — confirmed by grep). Confirmed.

**Verify (real runs, live DB — which still has pre-0148 names; applying 0148 is human-gated).**
`npm run build` green. `verify:m3` **13/13 PASSED** (dispatched by `location_type='safe_zone'` — it found
"Safe Rally Point" by TYPE, not name, proving the suites stay green on both sides of 0148; throwaway
`m3test.…@example.com` rows are covered by the established `%test%` cleanup path). `verify:m2` 10/11 with
ONE **PRE-EXISTING, name-independent** failure: `5 locations — got 8` — the human has revealed the three
starter ports in production, so `get_world_map()` now returns 8 active locations while m2 still pins the
pre-reveal count (its type-counts line still passes). NOT caused by this rename and NOT silently patched
here (changing the engine pin belongs to the OSN/port-subsystem diagnosis step, flagged for it). Local
note: Node needed `--use-system-ca` for TLS on this machine (environmental only).

## 2026-07-05 — UX CLEANUP (item 1) — retire the legacy Train Ships / Training Queue / map ExpeditionCommand UI (frontend-only; backend RPCs intentionally untouched)

**Request.** Player-facing UX/cleanup pass, slice 1 of 6: remove the three superseded legacy UI surfaces
(`TrainShipsPanel`, `BuildQueuePanel` in the Command Center; `ExpeditionCommand` in the Galaxy Map detail
panel) plus everything that becomes dead SOLELY as a result. UI-only retirement — no migration, RPC, cron,
or flag change.

**Removed (each verified zero-reference by grep before deletion).**
- Mounts + imports: `Dashboard.tsx` (TrainShipsPanel, BuildQueuePanel), `GalaxyMapScreen.tsx`
  (ExpeditionCommand); no wrapper markup existed beyond the JSX elements themselves.
- Component files: `src/features/production/TrainShipsPanel.tsx`, `src/features/production/BuildQueuePanel.tsx`,
  `src/features/map/ExpeditionCommand.tsx`.
- Dead-code chain orphaned by the above (all grep-verified zero remaining consumers):
  `src/features/production/productionApi.ts` (`fetchBuildOrders`/`trainUnits`/`cancelBuildOrder`) +
  `productionTypes.ts` (`BuildOrder`) → `src/features/production/` now empty, directory removed;
  `src/game/production/buildPreview.ts` (preview helpers) → `src/game/production/` removed;
  `buildOrders` state/fetch in `useGameState.ts`; `baseUnits` + `unitTypes` state/fetch in
  `useGalaxyMapData.ts` (only ExpeditionCommand consumed them); `sendFleetToLocation` + `SelectedUnit`
  in `fleets/fleetApi.ts` and `DispatchResult` in `fleets/fleetTypes.ts`.
- Kept (still consumed elsewhere, verified): `lib/time` `formatDuration`/`formatCountdown`,
  `baseApi.fetchBaseUnits`, `catalog.fetchUnitTypes`, `ExpeditionLauncher` (a nav link, no fleet API use),
  `MainShipCommand` (the deliberate Phase 10D/10H replacement surface — stale comment updated),
  `fleetApi.requestLeaveLocation` (FleetStatusPanel).
- Tests: `tests/m45.spec.ts` (M4.5 Train/Queue browser acceptance) and `tests/galaxy9b.spec.ts` (9B map
  expedition send) existed ENTIRELY to drive the removed UI → deleted, with their npm scripts
  (`verify:m45:browser`, `verify:galaxy9b:browser`). `tests/galaxy.spec.ts` (9A read-only smoke) adjusted:
  now asserts the legacy expedition surface is ABSENT and keeps the no-fleet-created invariants.
- Workflow dangling-reference cleanup (both dispatch-only, human-triggered; nothing dispatched):
  `.github/workflows/browser.yml` deleted (its only test step ran the removed `verify:m45:browser`);
  the 9B step removed from `browser-galaxy.yml` (its 9A step + cleanup step remain). NOTE: workflows were
  outside the locked MAY-touch list — flagged here for explicit human review; `cleanup-m45-orphans.yml`
  (DB row cleanup) kept, it does not reference the spec.

**Backend intentionally intact.** `train_units`, `cancel_build_order`, `send_fleet_to_location`, the
`process-build-queue` + `process-fleet-movements` 30s crons, and all tables/writers are untouched and now
simply unreferenced from the client. The backend `verify:m45` (node) engine script and M2/M3/M4 suites are
unaffected. `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` needs NO change: no table, writer, flag, or cross-system edge
changed — the ownership matrix documents the (unchanged) server surfaces, not client mounts. Confirmed.

**Doc-sync (same step).** Stale current-tense references to the retired surfaces annotated with dated
notes (historical text preserved, not rewritten): `docs/MAINSHIP_TRANSITION.md` §2 frontend-touchpoints
("the only send surface") + its tests-pin line + §7 ("keeps … galaxy9b green") + a new **10D (2026-07-05
update)** bullet in the implemented-vs-planned reconciliation note; `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §16 M7 row
("Train Ships + Training Queue UI" → client UI retired, server RPCs/cron remain). Repo-wide doc grep
confirms no other doc states the removed files/specs as current fact (remaining mentions are DEV_LOG
history and dated recon snapshots).

**Verify.** `npm run build` (tsc -b + vite) green after the removals; 160 modules, no unused-import or
type errors. SAFE FOR HUMAN MERGE REVIEW.

## 2026-07-05 — RANKING-P17 POST-AUDIT FIX (item 5) — schedule the ranking-accrual cron; world-tick already scheduled, no redundant cron (migration 0147)

**Request.** Item (5), the deferred background schedulers: add the ranking-accrual cron, and document
that world-balance is already scheduled (no redundant cron). NEW forward-only migration mirroring the
`0033` cron idiom EXACTLY; same-step doc-sync. No flag flip, no shipped-migration edit, no new
function/table, not applied/dispatched to any DB.

**The resolution.** Investigation confirmed only ONE background job genuinely lacked a scheduler:
- **Ranking-accrual** (`ranking_accrue_standings`, 0130/0144/0145) had NO cron (shipped as a safe dark
  no-op, "deferred"). → **This migration schedules it.**
- **World-balance world-tick** is ALREADY scheduled. Phase-19 folded ALL its dynamics INTO
  `worldstate_tick()` itself — pirate-pressure (0135), price-drift (0136), field-depletion (0137) are
  `create or replace` extensions of that ONE function — and `worldstate_tick()` is already driven every
  60s by the pre-existing `process-location-state-ticks` cron (0033 →
  `process_location_state_ticks()` → `worldstate_tick()`). → **No second cron added: a redundant
  schedule would DOUBLE-TICK every world-balance dynamic** (double pressure decay / price drift / field
  regen-and-depletion). World-balance stays gated by its own dark no-op flag `world_balance_enabled`.

**Work done (migration 0147 — `20260618000147_ranking_p17_accrue_cron.sql`).** Mirrors `0033` verbatim:
`create extension if not exists pg_cron;` → the idempotent unschedule `do`-block for jobname
`'ranking-accrue-standings'` (the `exception when undefined_table then null` guard copied verbatim) →
```
select cron.schedule(
  'ranking-accrue-standings',
  '*/5 * * * *',
  $$select public.ranking_accrue_standings();$$
);
```
Scheduled DIRECTLY — no `process_*` wrapper: `ranking_accrue_standings` is already a self-contained,
service-role-granted entry point with its own dark gate, so a wrapper would be dead abstraction (unlike
0033, which wraps `worldstate_tick()`).

**Cadence rationale (self-approved) — every 5 minutes (`*/5 * * * *`).** Standings are a SLOW
incremental aggregate and the fold is idempotent + commit-safe (the 0144/0145 per-(season, grant) ledger
anti-join), so cadence affects ONLY leaderboard freshness, never correctness — a missed/late run simply
folds the backlog on the next firing (no grant is ever skipped). 5 minutes keeps boards fresh at
negligible load versus the 60s world heartbeat.

**Dark-no-op-until-flag (why scheduling now is safe).** `ranking_accrue_standings` self-checks
`ranking_enabled` FIRST (0145: dark gate before any read/write) and returns `feature_disabled` without
folding/writing anything while the flag is `'false'`. So installing the schedule changes NOTHING
observable today — every firing is an instant no-op — and it begins accruing the moment the owner flips
`ranking_enabled` true (no further migration needed).

**Doc-sync (same step).** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`: the §1 `ranking_standings` row, the §2 Ranking
accrual description, and the Ranking acyclic-edge blockquote all changed from "no cron scheduled yet
(deferred)" to "cron-driven every 5 minutes (`ranking-accrue-standings`, 0147) — dark no-op while
`ranking_enabled='false'`"; the §3 cron topology section gains a `ranking_accrue_standings()` *(cron
5min)* entry and the `process_location_state_ticks()` entry now notes the world-balance world-tick is
this SAME 60s cron (no cron of its own — a second would double-tick). This DEV_LOG entry added.

**Preserved human gates.** `ranking_enabled` stays `'false'` (dark) — the scheduled job is a no-op until
the human flips it; `world_balance_enabled` untouched (its 60s tick stays a dark no-op). No flag flipped,
no shipped migration (0001–0146, incl. mining 0143, ranking 0144/0145, exploration 0146) edited, no new
function/table, and this migration is NOT applied or dispatched to any database. SAFE FOR HUMAN MERGE
REVIEW.

## 2026-07-05 — CAPTAIN-P16 POST-AUDIT UI (panel 4 of 4) — the dark Captain Progression (recruit) screen, EXTENDING `src/features/captains/` (frontend-only; no server change)

**Request.** Item (4), panel 4 of 4: build the dark Captain Progression (recruit) screen by EXTENDING
the existing `src/features/captains/` feature (reuse `captainsApi.ts`/`captainsTypes.ts` — no parallel
dir, no duplicated roster read/types), reading the roster via the existing `get_my_captain_instances`,
recipes via the existing public-read catalogs by direct select, and submitting ONLY the existing
`recruit_captain` command — NO new server authority. Frontend-only.

**Files touched (2 extended + 1 new + a mount edit).**
- `src/features/captains/captainsTypes.ts` (EXTENDED) — added `RecipeIngredient`, `CaptainRecipe`
  (assembled client-side, with display names), `RecruitCaptainResult`, and `recruitCaptainErrorMessage`.
- `src/features/captains/captainsApi.ts` (EXTENDED) — added `recruitCaptain(requestId, captainType)`
  (thin `supabase.rpc`, fail-closed, request_id a `crypto.randomUUID()` string — TEXT param) and
  `getCaptainRecipes()` (three DIRECT public-read selects joined client-side; fail-closed to `[]`).
- `src/features/captains/RecruitCaptainPanel.tsx` (NEW) — the dark recruit panel (props `lifecycleKey`;
  no ship id — recruit is inventory→captain).
- Mounted `<RecruitCaptainPanel/>` in `src/features/map/GalaxyMapScreen.tsx` adjacent to `<CaptainsPanel/>`.

**Enumerated REAL client codes (read from 0126 — not invented; and it is CODE-keyed, not reason-keyed).**
Unlike the assign/unassign wrappers (reason-keyed), the `recruit_captain` wrapper is CODE-keyed (the 0109
craft-command mirror). The real client codes: `feature_disabled` (there is NO `captain_progression_disabled`
— the wrapper returns `feature_disabled`), `not_authenticated`, `invalid_request` (mapped from the
internal `invalid_request_id`), `unknown_captain`, `no_recipe`, `insufficient_items` (+ `item_id`/`have`/
`need` payload), and the `unavailable` fallback. `recruitCaptainErrorMessage` prefers the server `message`,
then maps the code, then appends the insufficient_items shortfall (the ModulesPanel craft-error idiom).

**Recipe catalog read approach.** `getCaptainRecipes()` does three DIRECT public-read selects —
`captain_recipe_ingredients` (captain_type_id, item_id, qty; 0125), `captain_types` (id, name,
specialization), `item_types` (item_id, name) — all `grant select to anon, authenticated` catalogs, the
shipped direct-select convention (no RPC). It joins them client-side into per-type `CaptainRecipe` rows
with item display names; any select error fails closed to `[]`.

**Affordability NOT annotated (honest, no new authority).** The only inventory-balance function
`inventory_get_balance` (0039) is service_role-only (no client grant), and item (4) forbids adding a
client read RPC — so the panel shows recipe COSTS only and relies on the server's `insufficient_items`
{item_id, have, need} payload on attempt (surfaced by the decorator). No new RPC added.

**Fail-closed + THE VISIBILITY-GATE DECISION (documented honestly in the panel header).**
`captain_progression_enabled` (0124) is gated ONLY in the recruit COMMAND (0126) — there is NO existing
read RPC gated on it, and item (4) forbids adding one. So this panel derives VISIBILITY from the captain
system's existing gated roster read `get_my_captain_instances` (gated on `captain_assignment_enabled`) —
progression is the recruitment face of the captain system — rendering `null` unless `isServerLit(roster)`.
The recruit COMMAND remains the AUTHORITATIVE `captain_progression_enabled` gate: while progression is dark
it returns `feature_disabled`, surfaced inline on click (never a false success). The server is the sole
control; no client flag enables recruiting. CAVEAT recorded: if `captain_assignment_enabled` is lit but
`captain_progression_enabled` is not, the panel shows recipes with a Recruit affordance the server rejects
`feature_disabled` on click — a dedicated progression-gated read surface (to also hide the affordance on
the progression flag) is the clean future follow-up, out of this fix pass's no-new-authority scope.

**Per-type recruit wiring.** Each recipe row keys its own `pending`/`rowNote` by `captain_type_id` (the
ModulesPanel Record-keyed idiom) and submits `recruitCaptain(crypto.randomUUID(), captain_type_id)` via
`runGuardedCommand`, refreshing the roster on success and showing `recruitCaptainErrorMessage(res)` on
failure.

**Mount point.** `GalaxyMapScreen`, immediately after `CaptainsPanel` — no ship id needed, just a
`lifecycleKey`; non-spatial, placed at `left-[66.5rem]` in the bottom-left overlay row (after captains at
`left-[50rem]`), overlapping none. Renders `null` while dark, so production is byte-unchanged.

**Build.** `npm run build` (`tsc -b && vite build`) GREEN — no type or build errors (the >500 kB
chunk-size note is a pre-existing vite advisory, unrelated).

**Boundaries.** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` needs NO change — FRONTEND-ONLY: no table, writer, RPC, or
cross-system edge. It consumes the existing 0125/0126/0123 surface already recorded in the §2 Captain /
Production contracts; a read/command UI consumer (incl. direct public-read catalog selects, already the
shipped convention) adds nothing to the ownership matrix or call graph.

**Preserved human gates.** `captain_progression_enabled` stays `'false'` (dark) — the recruit command is
server-rejected and, via the roster-gate reuse, the panel renders null while the captain system is dark;
no flag flipped, no migration/RPC/server-file changed, no new authority, nothing merged/deployed. This
completes item (4) — all 4 read-surface UI panels (ranking, investment, captains-assign, captains-recruit)
now exist dark. SAFE FOR HUMAN MERGE REVIEW.

## 2026-07-05 — CAPTAIN-P15 POST-AUDIT UI (panel 3 of 4) — the dark `src/features/captains/` assign/unassign screen (frontend-only; no server change)

**Request.** Item (4), panel 3 of 4: build the dark Captains (assign/unassign) screen as a new
`src/features/captains/` feature, mirroring `src/features/investment/` + `src/features/mining/` (the
`runGuardedCommand` guarded-submit) and the ModulesPanel per-row Record-keyed idiom, reading ONLY
`get_my_captain_instances` (0123) and submitting ONLY the existing `assign_captain_to_ship` /
`unassign_captain_from_ship` commands (0120/0121) — NO new server authority. Frontend-only.

**Files added (3 + a mount edit).**
- `src/features/captains/captainsTypes.ts` — pure discriminated-union types matching 0123/0120 jsonb
  exactly. NOTE these envelopes are REASON-keyed (not `code`): `GetMyCaptainInstancesResult =
  {ok:true, captains?: CaptainInstance[]} | {ok:false, reason?}` with `CaptainInstance` = {instance_id,
  captain_type_id, name, specialization, stats_json, main_ship_id (assigned ship | null), created_at};
  `AssignCaptainResult` / `UnassignCaptainResult = {ok:true, action, captain_instance_id, main_ship_id,
  idempotent_replay?} | {ok:false, reason?, message?}`. Plus `captainCommandErrorMessage(res)` — prefers
  the server `message`, else maps the enumerated `reason` (mirrors `miningExtractErrorMessage`).
- `src/features/captains/captainsApi.ts` — thin `supabase.rpc` wrappers `getMyCaptainInstances`,
  `assignCaptainToShip(requestId, captainInstanceId, mainShipId)`, `unassignCaptainFromShip(requestId,
  captainInstanceId)`, each catching transport errors → fail-closed. request_id passed as a
  `crypto.randomUUID()` STRING (the wrapper param is TEXT).
- `src/features/captains/CaptainsPanel.tsx` — dark, server-driven roster panel (props `mainShipId`,
  `lifecycleKey`): renders `null` unless `isServerLit(roster)`; when lit shows each captain (name,
  specialization, key stats from `stats_json`) with its assignment state and ONE per-row action — an
  unassigned captain shows "Assign to ship" (guarded behind `mainShipId != null`), an assigned captain
  shows "Unassign" — both via `runGuardedCommand` with a per-captain key (the ModulesPanel Record-keyed
  `pending`/`rowNote` idiom), a fresh `crypto.randomUUID()` per submit, refreshing on success and showing
  `captainCommandErrorMessage` on failure. `data-testid="captains-panel"`.
- Mounted `<CaptainsPanel/>` in `src/features/map/GalaxyMapScreen.tsx` after `ModulesPanel`.

**Enumerated REAL client `reason` codes (read from 0120 + 0121 — not invented).** The
`captain_command_client_envelope` mapper (0121) + the wrapper gates can return, to the client:
`captain_assignment_disabled` (the dark visibility signal, no message), `not_authenticated`,
`invalid_request` (the internal `invalid_request_id` is mapped to this), `ship_not_settled` (the 0121
settled-safe rule), `captain_not_owned`, `ship_not_owned`, `already_assigned`, `captain_slots_full`,
`not_assigned`, and the `unavailable` fallback. Every non-dark failure carries a server `message`, which
the decorator prefers.

**Fail-closed logic.** Visibility is 100% server-driven — NO client flag constant. While
`captain_assignment_enabled='false'` `get_my_captain_instances` returns
`{ok:false, reason:'captain_assignment_disabled'}` → `isServerLit(roster)` false → the panel returns
`null`. Transport errors collapse to `{ok:false}` the same way. The commands are also server-rejected
while dark; the UI is never the control.

**Per-row assign/unassign wiring.** Each captain row keys its own `pending`/`rowNote` by `instance_id`
(the ModulesPanel `Record<string, …>` idiom). Assign submits `assignCaptainToShip(crypto.randomUUID(),
instance_id, mainShipId)`; Unassign submits `unassignCaptainFromShip(crypto.randomUUID(), instance_id)`.
The server stays authoritative on ownership / slot cap / the settled-safe rule; the panel just reflects
the roster and surfaces the reason on failure.

**Mount point + rationale.** `GalaxyMapScreen`, immediately after `ModulesPanel` — the player's
`mainShip?.main_ship_id` is already in scope there (captains are assigned to that ship). Non-spatial like
Modules, so it sits at `left-[50rem]` in the bottom-left overlay row (after exploration/mining/modules),
overlapping none. Renders `null` while dark, so production is byte-unchanged.

**Build.** `npm run build` (`tsc -b && vite build`) GREEN — no type or build errors (the >500 kB
chunk-size note is a pre-existing vite advisory, unrelated).

**Boundaries.** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` needs NO change — FRONTEND-ONLY: no table, writer, RPC, or
cross-system edge. It consumes the existing 0120/0121/0123 surface already recorded in the §2 Captain
contract; a read/command UI consumer adds nothing to the ownership matrix or call graph.

**Preserved human gates.** `captain_assignment_enabled` stays `'false'` (dark) — the panel is
server-rejected and renders null; no flag flipped, no migration/RPC/server-file changed, no new
authority, nothing merged/deployed. SAFE FOR HUMAN MERGE REVIEW.

## 2026-07-05 — LOCATION-INVEST-P18 POST-AUDIT UI (panel 2 of 4) — the dark `src/features/investment/` Port Investment screen (frontend-only; no server change)

**Request.** Item (4), panel 2 of 4: build the dark Port Investment screen as a new
`src/features/investment/` feature, mirroring the just-built `src/features/ranking/` (leaderboard read +
own-standing derivation) AND `src/features/mining/` (the `runGuardedCommand` guarded-submit + client
`request_id` generation), reading ONLY the three existing 0134 RPCs and submitting ONLY the existing
0133 `invest_in_location` command — NO new server authority. Frontend-only: no migration/RPC/flag/server
change.

**Files added (3 + a mount edit).**
- `src/features/investment/investmentTypes.ts` — pure discriminated-union result types matching 0134/0133
  jsonb exactly: `GetLocationDevelopmentResult` (all_time_total, contributor_count, season_total,
  window_index, window_start, window_end), `GetLocationInvestmentLeaderboardResult` (rows: {rank,
  player_id, season_score}), `GetMyLocationInvestmentsResult` (rows: {investment_id, location_id,
  location_name, amount, invested_at}), `InvestInLocationResult` ({investment_id, location_id, amount,
  invested_at, idempotent_replay?} | {ok:false, code?}) — all `{ok:true,…}|{ok:false,code?}` so
  `isServerLit` narrows cleanly. Plus `investErrorMessage(code)` mirroring `miningExtractErrorMessage`.
- `src/features/investment/investmentApi.ts` — thin `supabase.rpc` wrappers `getLocationDevelopment`,
  `getLocationInvestmentLeaderboard`, `getMyLocationInvestments`, `investInLocation`, each catching
  transport errors → `{ok:false}` EXACTLY like `miningApi.ts` (fail-closed).
- `src/features/investment/InvestmentPanel.tsx` — dark, server-driven panel (props `locationId`,
  `mainShipId`, `lifecycleKey` like MiningPanel): on mount/refresh reads development + leaderboard + own
  history; renders `null` unless `isServerLit(development)`; when lit shows persistent development
  (all_time_total, contributor_count), the seasonal score (season_total + window bounds), the seasonal
  leaderboard with the own row highlighted, the caller's own history, and ONE Invest action (amount input
  → `investInLocation(mainShipId, amt, crypto.randomUUID())` via `runGuardedCommand`). `data-testid=
  "investment-panel"`.
- Mounted `<InvestmentPanel/>` in `src/features/map/GalaxyMapScreen.tsx` beside `DockServicesPanel`.

**Enumerated REAL writer codes (read from 0133 — not invented).** The `invest_in_location` wrapper +
private writer return exactly: `feature_disabled`, `invalid_request` (null request_id), `not_docked`,
`invalid_amount`, `insufficient_credits` (the real wallet code — NOT the instruction's placeholder
"insufficient_funds"), `not_authenticated`, `ship_not_owned`; success `{ok:true, investment_id,
location_id, amount, invested_at}` (+ `idempotent_replay` on a same-(player, request_id) replay).
`investErrorMessage` maps these exact codes with an `unavailable` fallback.

**Fail-closed logic.** Visibility is 100% server-driven — NO client flag constant. While
`location_investment_enabled='false'` every RPC returns `{ok:false, code:'feature_disabled'}` →
`isServerLit(development)` false → the panel returns `null`. An undocked ship (`locationId` null →
skipped read / `unknown_location`) and transport errors collapse to null the same way. The board appears
only when the human lights the flag AND the ship is docked at a port.

**Own-standing derivation (client-side only — no new RPC).** The panel reads the signed-in user id from
`authStore` and, among the returned leaderboard `rows`, highlights the row whose `player_id` matches
("(you)") and summarises "Your standing: #rank · score". Absent → "Unranked — outside the top N".
Computed purely from the already-returned rows, never a server call.

**Mount point + rationale.** `GalaxyMapScreen`, immediately after `DockServicesPanel`. Chosen over the
Dashboard because BOTH the server-reported docked location (`mainShipPresence?.location_id` — the same id
`PortNavPanel` consumes as `currentDockedLocationId`) and the player's `mainShip?.main_ship_id` are
already in scope there: the reads are location-scoped and the invest command uses the ship whose docked
location the server derives, so the docked-port context is the natural home. Chosen over mounting INSIDE
`DockServicesPanel` because that panel does not expose its resolved `location_id` to children — mounting
in the map screen (which already holds both ids) is the smaller change (no prop-drilling / DockServices
refactor). It renders `null` while dark and when not docked, so production is byte-unchanged.

**Build.** `npm run build` (`tsc -b && vite build`) GREEN — 161 modules transformed, no type or build
errors (the >500 kB chunk-size note is a pre-existing vite advisory, unrelated).

**Boundaries.** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` needs NO change — FRONTEND-ONLY: no table, writer, RPC, or
cross-system edge. It consumes the existing 0133/0134 surface already recorded in the §2 Location
Investment contract; a read/command UI consumer adds nothing to the ownership matrix or call graph.

**Preserved human gates.** `location_investment_enabled` stays `'false'` (dark) — the panel is
server-rejected and renders null; no flag flipped, no migration/RPC/server-file changed, no new
authority, nothing merged/deployed. SAFE FOR HUMAN MERGE REVIEW.

## 2026-07-05 — RANKING-P17 POST-AUDIT UI (panel 1 of 4) — the dark `src/features/ranking/` leaderboard screen (frontend-only; no server change)

**Request.** Item (4), panel 1 of 4: build the dark Ranking screen as a new `src/features/ranking/`
feature mirroring `src/features/events` and the shared fail-closed idiom, reading ONLY the two existing
0131 RPCs (`get_ranking_seasons` / `get_ranking_leaderboard`) — NO new server authority. Frontend-only:
no migration/RPC/flag/server-file change.

**Files added (3 + a mount edit).**
- `src/features/ranking/rankingTypes.ts` — pure discriminated-union result types mirroring the 0131
  jsonb exactly: `RankingSeason` (season_id, cadence, label, starts_at, ends_at, status), `RankingRow`
  (rank, player_id, score, events_counted), `RankingDimension` ('overall'|'combat'|'trade'|
  'exploration'|'mining'), and `GetRankingSeasonsResult` / `GetRankingLeaderboardResult` as
  `{ok:true, …} | {ok:false, code?}` so `isServerLit` narrows the success member cleanly (the
  eventsTypes.ts idiom; arrays optional for defensive `?? []`).
- `src/features/ranking/rankingApi.ts` — two thin `supabase.rpc` wrappers `getRankingSeasons()` +
  `getRankingLeaderboard(seasonId, dimension, limit?)`, each catching transport/DB errors and collapsing
  to `{ok:false}` EXACTLY like `eventsApi.ts` (fail-closed; a denied/failed call is not server-lit).
- `src/features/ranking/RankingPanel.tsx` — dark, server-driven leaderboard: on mount / lifecycle
  change reads `getRankingSeasons()`; renders `null` unless `isServerLit(seasons)` AND ≥1 season exists;
  when lit, default-selects the active season (else the first) + dimension `'overall'`, fetches
  `getRankingLeaderboard(season_id, dimension)`, and renders ranked rows (rank, short player_id, score,
  events_counted) with minimal season + dimension selectors (the 0131 domain). Uses the shared
  `useActivityPanelGuards` mounted-guard + a `lifecycleKey` refetch trigger exactly like
  `WorldEventsPanel`. `data-testid="ranking-panel"` mirrors the events panel.
- Mounted `<RankingPanel lifecycleKey={user?.id ?? 'anon'} />` in `src/features/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx`
  as a dark server-lit section (a season leaderboard is a top-level standing surface, not a map overlay;
  the Dashboard is the post-auth landing). It renders `null` while dark, so the Dashboard is
  byte-unchanged in production.

**Fail-closed logic.** Visibility is 100% server-driven — there is NO client flag constant. While
`ranking_enabled='false'` both RPCs return `{ok:false, code:'feature_disabled'}` → `isServerLit` is
false → the panel returns `null`. Transport/DB errors collapse to `{ok:false}` in the API layer and
fail closed identically. The board only appears once the human lights the flag AND opens a season.

**Own-standing derivation (client-side only — no new RPC).** There is no `get_my_standing` RPC by
design. The panel reads the signed-in user id from `authStore` and, among the returned leaderboard
`rows`, highlights the row whose `player_id` matches (marked "(you)") and summarises "Your standing:
#rank · score · events". If the player is absent from the returned rows it shows a small "Unranked —
outside the top N" line — computed purely from the already-returned rows, never a server call.

**Build.** `npm run build` (`tsc -b && vite build`) GREEN — 158 modules transformed, no type or build
errors (the >500 kB chunk-size note is a pre-existing vite advisory, unrelated).

**Boundaries.** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` needs NO change — this is FRONTEND-ONLY: no table, no
writer, no RPC, no cross-system edge. It consumes the existing 0131 read surface already recorded in the
§2 Ranking contract; a UI consumer adds nothing to the ownership matrix or call graph (the established
precedent that read-only UI over an existing RPC is not a boundary fact).

**Preserved human gates.** `ranking_enabled` stays `'false'` (dark) — the panel is server-rejected and
renders null; no flag flipped, no migration/RPC/server-file changed, no new authority, nothing
merged/deployed. SAFE FOR HUMAN MERGE REVIEW.

## 2026-07-05 — EXPLORATION-P11 POST-AUDIT FIX — convert the racing duplicate-scan insert into a clean `already_discovered` (migration 0146)

**Request.** Post-audit fix pass, item 3: `exploration_scan`'s step-11 discovery insert has no
`unique_violation` handler, so a racing duplicate surfaces a raw SQL error instead of the clean
`already_discovered` envelope the pre-check already returns. Fix as a NEW forward-only migration
`CREATE OR REPLACE`-ing the writer, changing exactly ONE thing (wrap the insert); same-step doc-sync.
No flag flip, no shipped-migration edit, no new table/RPC.

**The gap.** `exploration_scan` (0099) selects the nearest UNDISCOVERED site via a `not exists`
pre-check (0099:181-182), then at step 11 does a BARE insert into `exploration_discoveries`
(0099:200-202) with NO exception handler. The `unique (player_id, site_id)` constraint keeps a player's
discovery of a site to exactly one row, but if two scans of the SAME player race past the pre-check for
the SAME site (a TOCTOU window between the step-10 check and the insert), the second insert raises a raw
`unique_violation` that propagates UNCAUGHT — instead of the clean `{ok:false, reason:'already_discovered'}`
the settled-duplicate path returns (0099:192).

**The fix (exactly ONE change vs 0099).** Wrap the step-11 insert in a `begin … exception when
unique_violation then return jsonb_build_object('ok', false, 'reason', 'already_discovered'); end;`
sub-block. `v_now := clock_timestamp();` stays OUTSIDE/BEFORE the block (unchanged position); the
success path (`v_result` + the step-12 receipt insert + `return v_result`) stays AFTER the block so it
runs only on a successful insert. Verified by diff: the ONLY change is the wrap — signature, dark-flag
gate, ship-lock/ownership/validation/cross-domain order, receipt lookup, site selection, the pre-check
`already_discovered`/`no_site_in_range` branch, and the public wrapper `command_exploration_scan` are
byte-identical to 0099 (`CREATE OR REPLACE` preserves the 0099 ACL, so it and `osn_distance` and the
wrapper are not re-run). The wrapper already maps `already_discovered` → code/message (0099:283/296), so
the caught path flows through it unchanged.

**This is POLISH, not a double-discovery fix (conservation was already protected).** The `unique
(player_id, site_id)` constraint is the sole authority and already guaranteed at-most-one discovery per
(player, site) — the losing insert was always rejected. The only defect was the SHAPE of that rejection
(a raw error vs the truthful `already_discovered`); this hardens the error handling.

**Honest reachability (defense-in-depth today).** The two racing scans must be DIFFERENT commands
(distinct `request_id`, so the 0055 receipt replay does not absorb them) on the SAME player at the SAME
site — which needs two in-space ships of one player. A player holds >1 main ship only via
`commission_additional_main_ship` (0080), DARK behind `mainship_additional_commission_enabled='false'`,
so the racing path is LATENT today (defense-in-depth), becoming live only if/when multi-ship-per-player
is activated — mirroring the mining 0143 posture. PERMANENT guard, not a shim (no retirement; multi-ship
activation is its relevance trigger).

**Doc-sync (same step).** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` §2 Exploration contract note UPDATED — it
documented the scan's idempotency posture INACCURATELY (claimed a `race-guarded on conflict (player_id,
site_id) do nothing` that was never in 0099); corrected to the real mechanism: the `not exists`
pre-check PLUS the 0146 `unique_violation` catch → `already_discovered`, guarded by the `unique
(player_id, site_id)` constraint, with the honest latent-two-ship reachability. No table/writer/edge
changes, so the §1 matrix is untouched (the behavior-refinement precedent). This DEV_LOG entry added.

**Preserved human gates.** `exploration_enabled` stays `'false'` (dark) — every call is still
server-rejected `feature_disabled` before this code is reached; no flag flipped, no shipped migration
(0001–0145, incl. mining 0143 and ranking 0144/0145) edited, no new table/RPC, nothing
merged/deployed/applied to production. SAFE FOR HUMAN MERGE REVIEW.

## 2026-07-05 — RANKING-P17 POST-AUDIT FIX — the deferred commit-safety PROOF `scripts/ranking-p17-commit-safe-accrual-proof.sh` (no migration/flag change)

**Request.** The "Verify" for item (2): a dynamic proof that the slice-B commit-safe fold actually
counts a reward that COMMITS after an overlapping accrual run — the exact scenario the old timestamp
cursor skipped forever — mirroring the deferred-proof idiom used for item (1). Only changes this slice:
the new script + this note.

**The proof (`scripts/ranking-p17-commit-safe-accrual-proof.sh`).** Mirrors
`scripts/mining-p12-double-extract-concurrency.sh` / `scripts/osn3-s3-realchain-concurrency.sh`
point-for-point: a FIFO-driven held-open psql session (distinct `application_name`), `pg_stat_activity`
state polling, a `trap` that restores `ranking_enabled` to `'false'` and asserts it + cleans all
fixtures, `$DB_URL`-gated, never touches a shared/live DB.

**Scenario staged (the exact skip case).** Under `ranking_enabled` toggled true ONLY in the disposable
stack: (1) one ACTIVE `ranking_seasons` row whose window spans the test + one throwaway player; (2)
session A `begin`s and inserts a `reward_grants` row so its `granted_at` is stamped at A's txn START
(T1), and HOLDS the txn open (uncommitted ⇒ invisible); (3) grant B is inserted AND committed for a
later `granted_at` (T2 > T1) in the same window; (4) `ranking_accrue_standings()` runs once — sees only
B (A invisible): asserts B folded into `ranking_standings` (score/events 5/1) and B in
`ranking_counted_grants`, A absent from the ledger; (5) session A commits (commit time T3 > T2, but
A.granted_at is still the older T1) — the script asserts A.granted_at < B.granted_at AND A.granted_at <
the run-1 watermark (`last_counted_at` ≈ T2), pinning that this is precisely the row the OLD 0130
`granted_at > last_counted_at` cursor would exclude forever; (6) `ranking_accrue_standings()` runs
again and asserts the 0145 anti-join COUNTS A — A now in the ledger, standings rise to 8/2 (exactly A's
+3 score / +1 event), exactly TWO grants folded for (season, player), and B still counted exactly once
(no double-count — the ledger `unique (season_id, grant_id)` + anti-join).

**Why this proves "no finalized reward is ever missed."** A is visible to a run only once committed;
whenever it first becomes visible — however late, whatever its `granted_at` — it is absent from the
ledger, so the visibility-based anti-join includes it and folds it exactly once. The counterfactual
(the old watermark dropping A because T1 < the advanced watermark) is documented in the header and
pinned by the T1-below-watermark assertion, but not executed (the old function no longer exists).

**Run instructions (DEFERRED to the human activation checklist).** `DB_URL=postgres://... bash
scripts/ranking-p17-commit-safe-accrual-proof.sh`. NOT wired into `package.json`'s dark `verify:*`
block — it needs a LIT DB (it flips `ranking_enabled` true INSIDE its disposable stack and restores it)
and so cannot run in the flag-off sweep; referenced only from its own header and this note. This
environment has no local DB, so the lit run is deferred; static-checked green here with `bash -n`.

**Preserved human gates.** No migration edited, no committed file flips a flag — the script's `true`
toggle is a runtime `psql` update inside a disposable `$DB_URL` stack, restored to the captured
original (`'false'`) and asserted in the trap. `ranking_enabled` stays `'false'` in every committed
file; no `package.json` entry added; nothing merged/deployed/applied to production.
SAFE FOR HUMAN MERGE REVIEW.

## 2026-07-05 — RANKING-P17 POST-AUDIT FIX, SLICE B — `ranking_accrue_standings` made COMMIT-SAFE by folding through the `ranking_counted_grants` ledger (migration 0145)

**Request.** Post-audit fix pass, item 2, slice B: rewrite `ranking_accrue_standings` so correctness no
longer depends on the `granted_at` timestamp watermark. NEW forward-only migration
`CREATE OR REPLACE`-ing the accrual writer, changing ONLY the fold; preserve everything else verbatim;
same-step doc-sync + verifier update. No flag flip, no shipped-migration edit, no writer for any other
table, `ranking_score_delta` unchanged.

**The bug (recap).** 0130's fold is INCREMENTAL by `ranking_standings.last_counted_at`: it counts only
grants with `granted_at > last_counted_at` and advances the mark. `reward_grants.granted_at` defaults to
the inserting txn's START time (`20260616000015...:14`), but a row is VISIBLE to the reader only at
COMMIT. A grant whose txn started before a run yet commits after that run advanced the watermark past
its `granted_at` is PERMANENTLY skipped — silently dropped points under concurrent finalization.

**Before → after (the fold is the ONLY change).**
- BEFORE (0130): a pure `folded` CTE selects grants with a HIGH-WATER FILTER
  `((st.last_counted_at is null and rg.granted_at >= s.starts_at) or (rg.granted_at > st.last_counted_at))`
  via a LEFT JOIN to the existing standings row, groups by (season, player, dimension), then `upserted`
  reads `folded`. Correctness depends on the timestamp watermark.
- AFTER (0145): a data-modifying `newly_counted` CTE
  `insert into ranking_counted_grants (…) select … from reward_grants rg join ranking_seasons s on
  s.status='active' and rg.granted_at between s.starts_at and s.ends_at where rg.source_type in (…4…)
  and not exists (select 1 from ranking_counted_grants c where c.season_id=s.season_id and
  c.grant_id=rg.id) on conflict (season_id, grant_id) do nothing returning season_id, player_id,
  dimension, score, granted_at`. Then `aggregated` groups the RETURNING rows by (season, player,
  dimension) (score=Σ, events_counted=count, last_counted_at=max granted_at), and `upserted` reads
  `aggregated` with the SAME `on conflict (season_id, player_id, dimension) do update set score =
  t.score + excluded.score, …, last_counted_at = greatest(…), updated_at = now()` shape as 0130.

**Why the anti-join is commit-safe (and never skips a finalized reward).** The fold no longer asks
"is this grant newer than the watermark?" (a time question, defeated by commit-after-start visibility);
it asks "is this grant already in the ledger for this season?" (a VISIBILITY question). A grant becomes
visible to a run only once committed; whenever it first becomes visible — however late, whatever its
`granted_at` — it is not yet in the ledger, so the `not exists` anti-join includes it and the run marks
+ folds it exactly once. `unique (season_id, grant_id)` + `on conflict do nothing` guarantee at-most-once
even under a raced run (belt-and-braces with the global advisory lock); a re-run with nothing unmarked
inserts nothing and upserts nothing (idempotent). No `granted_at` ordering assumption remains, so no
late-committing grant is ever dropped.

**`last_counted_at` is now INFORMATIONAL.** It is still written (max `granted_at` among grants folded
this run, kept via `greatest`) for audit/display, but is NEVER read back as a cursor — the ledger's
anti-join is the correctness cursor. The COLUMN is intentionally NOT dropped (a forward-only column drop
is out of scope for this fix); the migration/function comments state this explicitly.

**Preserved VERBATIM from 0130 (verified by code-only diff).** The signature
`ranking_accrue_standings() returns jsonb`, `language plpgsql security definer set search_path = public`,
the declare block, the DARK-GATE-FIRST `cfg_bool('ranking_enabled')` reject, the
`pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext('ranking_accrue_standings'), 0)` serialize, the three summary aggregate
expressions (`count(distinct season_id)`, `count(*)`, `coalesce(sum(events_counted),0)` — only the FROM
source changed `folded`→`aggregated`), the `jsonb_build_object('ok', true, 'seasons_scored', …,
'rows_upserted', …, 'events_folded', …)` result shape, and the service-role-only ACL block are all
byte-identical. `ranking_score_delta` is UNCHANGED and NOT redefined here (0130 owns it and its grants).

**Sole-writer status.** `ranking_accrue_standings` remains the SOLE writer of `ranking_standings` and is
now the REALIZED sole writer of `ranking_counted_grants` (0144's deferred writer). No second write path
to either table.

**Doc-sync (same step).** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`: §1 `ranking_standings` fold note rewritten to the
commit-safe ledger anti-join with `last_counted_at` informational; §1 `ranking_counted_grants` row now
shows the REALIZED sole writer `ranking_accrue_standings` (0145); §2 Ranking contract's Owns entry,
accrual description, and Role fold note all updated to the anti-join (present tense). Edges unchanged:
Ranking → Reward (`reward_grants` read) + Reference/Config (`cfg_bool`), DOWNWARD, acyclic; nothing calls
into Ranking. **Verifier:** `scripts/verify-ranking.mjs` extended to assert `ranking_counted_grants` is
SERVER-ONLY — authenticated SELECT denied, anon SELECT denied, and a valid-shaped authenticated INSERT
denied — mirroring the existing table-denial assertions; no lit path, no flag flip.

**Preserved human gates.** `ranking_enabled` stays `'false'` (dark) — the writer still rejects
`feature_disabled` before any read; no flag flipped, no shipped migration (0001–0144, incl. mining 0143
and the slice-A schema 0144) edited, no new table, no cron, nothing merged/deployed/applied to
production. SAFE FOR HUMAN MERGE REVIEW.

## 2026-07-05 — RANKING-P17 POST-AUDIT FIX, SLICE A — the commit-safe consumption-ledger SCHEMA `ranking_counted_grants` (migration 0144; schema only, no writer)

**Request.** Post-audit fix pass, item 2: `ranking_accrue_standings`'s timestamp high-water cursor is
commit-unsafe. Build the fix in slices, schema first. Slice A = a NEW forward-only migration adding the
per-(season, grant) consumption ledger table ONLY (no writer — that is slice B), plus same-step
doc-sync. No flag flip, no shipped-migration edit (0001–0142 or the mining 0143), no new RPC/writer.

**The bug (commit-unsafe cursor).** `ranking_accrue_standings` (0130) is INCREMENTAL by a TIMESTAMP
high-water cursor, `ranking_standings.last_counted_at` (0128 decision 3): each run folds only grants
with `granted_at > last_counted_at` and advances the mark. But `reward_grants.granted_at` defaults to
`now()` = the inserting transaction's START time (`20260616000015_reward_system.sql:14`), while a row
becomes VISIBLE to the accrual reader only at COMMIT. A grant whose txn started BEFORE an accrual run
(small `granted_at`) but COMMITS AFTER that run advanced the watermark past its `granted_at` is then
PERMANENTLY SKIPPED — the next run's `granted_at > last_counted_at` filter excludes it forever. Under
normal concurrent finalization this silently drops points. `reward_grants` has a stable `id uuid` PK
(0015:8), so a per-row consumption marker is the correct, ordering-independent key.

**The fix (per-grant consumption marker; the securing `secured_at` idiom).** Replace timestamp-cursoring
with a visibility-based per-(season, grant) marker. `ranking_counted_grants` records, EXACTLY ONCE,
that a specific `reward_grants` row has been folded into a specific active season. Slice B's accrual
will select grants by an ANTI-JOIN against this table (grants NOT yet marked for the season) rather than
by a `granted_at` comparison — so a late-committing grant is simply ABSENT from the ledger and picked up
on the next run, regardless of `granted_at` ordering. Commit-safe by construction, exactly-once (the
`unique (season_id, grant_id)` key), idempotent. This is the SAME per-row consumption-marker idiom the
codebase already uses for commit-safe idempotency — the securing processors' `secured_at` mark
(0100/0105) that the 0128/0130 accrual comment itself cites as its analogue — here materialized as its
own ledger row (one grant folds once PER active season it belongs to, so the marker is per-(season,
grant), not a single column on the grant). PERMANENT correctness structure, NOT a shim; it does not
retire — the timestamp cursor is simply what slice B stops depending on.

**Work done (migration 0144 — `20260618000144_ranking_p17_counted_grants_schema.sql`).** Created
`public.ranking_counted_grants` (schema/RLS/index/comments only, mirroring the 0128 standings style):
`id uuid PK`, `season_id → ranking_seasons(season_id) ON DELETE CASCADE`, `grant_id → reward_grants(id)
ON DELETE CASCADE`, `player_id → auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`, `dimension text` with the IDENTICAL
0128 closed-set CHECK `('combat','trade','exploration','mining')` (reused, not re-spelled), `score
numeric`, `granted_at timestamptz` (informational snapshot, NOT a cursor), `counted_at timestamptz
default now()`, and `unique (season_id, grant_id)` (the exactly-once key; its index also serves the
anti-join lookup). Added `ranking_counted_grants_fold_idx (season_id, player_id, dimension)` for the
per-standings-row aggregation. SERVER-ONLY posture (the 0103 securing-table stance, NOT the 0128
public-read stance): RLS enabled, NO policy, NO `anon`/`authenticated` grant → clients can neither read
nor write; the SECURITY DEFINER writer (slice B) reaches it as definer-owner. NO writer created this
slice.

**Boundaries / doc-sync (same step).** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` §1 matrix gains the
`ranking_counted_grants` row (sole writer = `ranking_accrue_standings` (slice B); server-only, no client
read; DARK behind `ranking_enabled`), adjacent to `ranking_standings`; the §2 Ranking row's Owns is
extended and its accrual note now flags the `last_counted_at` timestamp cursor as commit-unsafe and
being replaced by this ledger's anti-join. Ranking stays a READ-ONLY downward leaf: reads Reward's
`reward_grants` DOWNWARD, writes only its own tables, nothing calls into Ranking — call graph unchanged
and acyclic. No new table adds any cross-system edge.

**Preserved human gates.** `ranking_enabled` stays `'false'` (dark) — no reader or writer references
the new table yet; no flag flipped, no shipped migration (0001–0143, incl. mining 0143) edited, no new
RPC/writer, nothing merged/deployed/applied to production. Verified: with RLS on and no policy/grant,
no `anon`/`authenticated` client can read or write `ranking_counted_grants`. SAFE FOR HUMAN MERGE REVIEW.

## 2026-07-05 — MINING-P12 POST-AUDIT RECONCILIATION — the 0143 double-extract race is NOT reachable today; honest reframing + deferred concurrency proof (no code/migration change)

**Request.** Before proving item (1), reconcile its reachability honestly against the code, correct the
0143 doc wording that overstated the race as reachable-today, and author the deferred concurrency proof
— WITHOUT editing migration 0143 (the guard is correct defense-in-depth and the explicit audit ask).

**Reachability verdict — I PARTIALLY DISAGREE with the stated premise (one factual correction).**
- CONFIRMED: `mainship_space_lock_context(p_main_ship_id, false)` does `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on
  `main_ship_instances` (`20260618000056_osn3_s2_transition_core.sql:46`), so two concurrent
  `mining_extract` calls on the SAME main ship serialize on the ship row lock — the second reads the
  first's committed extraction and is cooldown-rejected.
- CORRECTION: `main_ship_instances.player_id` is **NOT UNIQUE today**. The inline UNIQUE at
  `20260617000043_main_ship_instance.sql:47` (`main_ship_instances_player_id_key`) was **DROPPED in
  `20260618000079_trade_fleet_0c_drop_player_id_unique.sql`**. So "one main ship per player" is a
  DARK-GATE / runtime invariant, not a schema constraint.
- The path that COULD create a 2nd ship — `commission_additional_main_ship()`
  (`20260618000080...`) — exists and is real, but is DARK behind
  `mainship_additional_commission_enabled='false'` (cap `max_main_ships_per_player=3`); the first-ship
  writer is zero-ship-guarded. So every player holds ≤ 1 ship at runtime, and the "two ships of one
  player at one field" double-extract variant is **NOT constructible today**.
- NET: the `(player, field)` no-double-extract invariant IS already held today by [ship `FOR UPDATE`
  lock + cooldown read + the dark additional-commission gate keeping ≤ 1 ship/player]. The 0143
  advisory lock is **defense-in-depth**, inert today, becoming LOAD-BEARING the moment
  `mainship_additional_commission_enabled` is flipped true (multi-ship-per-player). This makes the
  guard MORE relevant than the premise implied — its trigger is an already-built dark capability, not
  a hypothetical future schema change.

**Doc corrections (this same step).** Reframed the prior-slice wording that implied reachability today:
- `docs/DEV_LOG.md` (the 0143 entry below): title changed from "close the double-extract race …" →
  "add a per-(player, field) advisory lock … as defense-in-depth …"; the "**The bug.**" paragraph
  reframed to "**The modeled race — reachability CORRECTED …**" stating the two-ship variant is not
  constructible today and why (dark commission gate; `0043` UNIQUE dropped in `0079`); the design-
  decision paragraph now records the LOAD-BEARING TRIGGER (`mainship_additional_commission_enabled`
  true).
- `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` (§2 Mining note): the phrase "the lock closes that window" (which
  implied an active window today) replaced with a reachability statement — invariant already held by
  the ship `FOR UPDATE` + cooldown + ≤ 1-ship dark gate; the advisory lock is defense-in-depth,
  load-bearing only if/when multi-ship is activated; permanent guard, no retirement.

**Deferred concurrency proof (new artifact).** `scripts/mining-p12-double-extract-concurrency.sh`,
mirroring `scripts/osn3-s3-realchain-concurrency.sh` point-for-point (real concurrent FIFO-driven psql
sessions, distinct `application_name`, `pg_stat_activity` wait-state, a `trap` that restores every
flag/tunable it toggled — `mining_enabled`→`false` asserted, `mining_extract_cooldown_seconds`→captured
original — plus fixture cleanup; `$DB_URL`-gated; never touches a shared/live DB). It proves the
REACHABLE invariant: fixtures = one user + one settled `in_space` main ship + one active `mining_fields`
row at the ship's coordinates (within `mining_extract_radius`) + a large cooldown, with `mining_enabled`
flipped true ONLY inside the disposable stack; two sessions issue `mining_extract` for that ship with
two DISTINCT `request_id`s → assert A succeeds (one extraction), B blocks on the ship `FOR UPDATE`, and
after A commits B returns `reason='cooldown'` (not a second extraction); final assert = exactly ONE
`mining_extractions` row for `(player, field)`. The two-ship variant is documented in the header as not
constructible today (dark commission gate; `0043` UNIQUE dropped in `0079`), so the proof covers the
reachable surface; the 0143 advisory `(player, field)` lock is additionally verified STRUCTURALLY
(present and ordered immediately before the cooldown read) as defense-in-depth (this check runs without
a DB). Static-checked green with `bash -n`. The LIT run is DEFERRED to the human owner's activation
checklist (this environment has no local DB, and no flag may be flipped in a committed artifact). It is
deliberately NOT added to the dark `verify:*` block in `package.json` (it needs a lit DB); referenced
only from its own header and this log.

**Preserved human gates.** No code or migration changed (0143 and all shipped migrations 0001–0142
untouched); the new script sets `mining_enabled='true'` ONLY at runtime inside a disposable `$DB_URL`
stack and restores it to `'false'`. `mining_enabled` stays `'false'` in every committed file. No flag
flipped, no `package.json` verify entry added, nothing merged/deployed/applied to production.
SAFE FOR HUMAN MERGE REVIEW.

## 2026-07-05 — MINING-P12 POST-AUDIT FIX — add a per-(player, field) advisory lock to `mining_extract` as defense-in-depth for the double-extract race (migration 0143)

**Request.** Post-audit fix pass, item 1: the mining `extract` command had a read-then-insert
double-extract race. Fix it as a NEW forward-only migration that `CREATE OR REPLACE`s the writer,
reproducing the 0104 body verbatim and changing exactly ONE thing — adding a per-(player, field)
advisory lock — then sync the law docs the same step. No flag flip, no shipped-migration edit, no new
RPC/table.

**The modeled race — reachability CORRECTED 2026-07-05 (see the reconciliation note above; this
paragraph was initially overstated as reachable-today and is now accurate).** `mining_extract` (0104,
step 11) reads the latest `mining_extractions.created_at` for `(player, field)` and, if older than
`mining_extract_cooldown_seconds`, inserts a new extraction. The S2 canonical ship lock
(`mainship_space_lock_context`, `20260618000056...:46` `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on
`main_ship_instances`) serializes commands on the SAME ship only. IF one player could hold TWO ships
both settled within `mining_extract_radius` of the SAME field, those two `mining_extract` calls would
lock distinct ship rows, never contend, both pass the read-then-insert cooldown check, and double-
extract — a double-reward window once `process_mining_securing` (0105) deposits both bundles. **That
two-ship configuration is NOT constructible at runtime today**: the ONLY additional-ship path
`commission_additional_main_ship` (0080) is DARK behind `mainship_additional_commission_enabled='false'`
(cap `max_main_ships_per_player=3`), and the first-ship writer is zero-ship-guarded, so every player
holds ≤ 1 main ship — two concurrent extracts therefore contend on the SAME ship row, and the second
reads the first's committed row and is cooldown-rejected. **NOTE (premise correction):** the original
`0043:47` `player_id` UNIQUE (`main_ship_instances_player_id_key`) was DROPPED in `0079`, so ≤ 1-ship
is a DARK-GATE / runtime invariant (the dark additional-commission flag), NOT a schema constraint. The
advisory lock is thus DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH — inert today, load-bearing the moment multi-ship-per-player is
activated.

**Work done (migration 0143 — `20260618000143_mining_p12_extract_double_extract_guard.sql`).**
`CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.mining_extract(...)`, body copied byte-for-byte from 0104 with a
SINGLE inserted block (new step "10b") between field resolution (step 10) and the cooldown read
(step 11): `perform pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext('mining_extract'), hashtext(p_player::text || ':'
|| v_field.id::text));`. Two commands for the same `(player, field)` now serialize there — the second
blocks until the first COMMITS, then reads the first's now-committed extraction at step 11 and is
correctly `cooldown`-rejected. Verified by diff: the ONLY change vs 0104 is the 10b comment + the
`perform` line; the signature, dark-flag gate, ship-lock/ownership order, receipt/idempotency logic,
cooldown math, selection rule, accrual/reward math, the public wrapper `command_mining_extract`, and
all grants are unchanged (`CREATE OR REPLACE` preserves the 0104 ACL, so the revoke/grant block is not
re-run).

**Idiom reused (not re-invented).** The established two-arg advisory-lock pattern
`pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext('<domain>'), hashtext('<scope>'))` already used at 0078 (commission),
0113 (fitting), 0126 (recruit), 0133 (location investment). Domain = `'mining_extract'`, scope = the
combined `(player, field)` key.

**Design decision — PERMANENT guard, no retirement condition; recorded load-bearing trigger.**
Xact-scoped advisory locks auto-release at commit/rollback (no cleanup path, no softlock risk —
NO-ACCOUNT-SOFTLOCK holds) and are reentrant within the transaction (harmless alongside the existing
S2 row locks). This is a correctness invariant of the writer, not a shim/compat path — it stays for the
life of the function (so "no retirement condition"). Its LOAD-BEARING TRIGGER is recorded: today it is
inert defense-in-depth (≤ 1 main ship per player ⇒ the ship `FOR UPDATE` lock already serializes the
`(player, field)` invariant); it becomes load-bearing the moment `mainship_additional_commission_enabled`
is flipped true (multi-ship-per-player), when two ships of one player at one field could otherwise
race the cooldown read.

**Boundaries / doc-sync (same step).** No new table, writer, or cross-system edge — this refines the
concurrency discipline of an EXISTING sole-writer (`mining_extract` remains the sole insert path of
`mining_extractions`). `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` §2 Mining contract row updated to document the new
per-(player, field) extract serialization lock in its pacing/concurrency note; this DEV_LOG entry
added.

**Preserved human gates.** `mining_enabled` stays `'false'` (dark) — every call is still
server-rejected `feature_disabled` before this lock is ever reached; no flag flipped, no shipped
migration (0001–0142) edited, no new RPC/table, nothing merged/deployed/applied to production.
SAFE FOR HUMAN MERGE REVIEW.

## 2026-07-05 — PHASE20-POLISH CLEANUP — independent re-audit of the closed polish milestone; ALL THREE audits CLEAN, ZERO remediation (docs-only close-out)

**Request.** The Phase-20 (Polish/expansion — map UI, portraits, icons, world events) milestone was
already CLOSED (see the SLICE 7 entry below) and its three cleanup audits reported clean. Rather than
trust that premise, re-establish the baseline and INDEPENDENTLY re-verify each audit against the actual
code, then record a durable close-out. Read-only audit throughout; this entry is the only artifact.

**Honest premise correction (found at STEP 1).** The three named audits were NOT previously persisted
as `*_RECON.local.md` recon docs — the only Phase-20 recon in the tree is the pre-build STEP-0 recon
(`WORLD_POLISH_P20_RECON.local.md`), and every `CLEANUP_*_RECON.local.md` covers an EARLIER phase
(11–19). So the milestone's "clean" verdict had been resting on the goal's premise plus the SLICE 7
close-out, not on persisted per-audit evidence. This entry is therefore the DURABLE record: the three
audits were re-run inline against `docs/DEV_LOG.md` + `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` + the on-disk source
(migrations `0139–0142`, `src/features/{events,assets}`, `scripts/verify-phase20-polish.mjs`).

**Audit 1 — World-Events / UI-Assets migrations `0139–0142` — CLEAN (all six properties PASS).**
- **Dark-gate-first** — `cfg_bool('phase20_polish_enabled')` is the FIRST executable statement in all
  four functions (`world_events_publish` `0140:87–89`, `world_events_set_active` `0140:167–169`,
  `get_world_events` `0141:48–50`, `get_ui_asset_catalog` `0142:109–111`); no table is touched before
  it. `cfg_bool` (`0046:17–24`) is a `stable`, read-only SQL select from `game_config`.
- **Exactly one sole-writer per table, no second writer anywhere** — tree-wide grep for
  `insert/update/delete` on either table returns only: `world_events` ← `world_events_publish`
  (`0140:130,146`) + `world_events_set_active` (`0140:176`); `ui_asset_catalog` ← the `0142:80` seed
  insert only (no runtime writer). Zero writes elsewhere; no `DELETE` (retire is a status flip).
- **Pure downward LEAF** — the writers touch only `world_events`; their sole cross-reference is a
  read-only `EXISTS` against the static Map (`zones` `0140:118–119`, `locations` `0140:122–123`) for FK
  validation. Grep for the four function names finds callers ONLY in their defining migrations — zero
  inbound edges, acyclic, no write into another system's table.
- **`ui_asset_catalog` seed-only static Reference/Config** — RLS on, all client grants revoked
  (`0142:60–61`); rows come only from the `0142:80–90` seed.
- **Grants** — writers service-role-only (`0140:186–190`); read RPCs authenticated-only
  (`0141:92–93`, `0142:136–137`).
- **Doc-sync accurate** — `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` (`:64–65, :107, :109`) documents both tables,
  both sole-writers, the downward-leaf boundary, the seed-only nature, and the grants with NO
  contradiction of the migration source.

**Audit 2 — Frontend `src/features/{events,assets}` — CLEAN (all four properties PASS).**
- **Reuses the shared helpers** — `WorldEventsPanel.tsx:2` imports `isServerLit` +
  `useActivityPanelGuards` from `src/lib/useActivityPanelGuards.ts` and calls them (`:34, :49, :61`);
  the icon resolver reads `get_ui_asset_catalog('icon')` through the shared `supabase.rpc` wrapper
  (`assetsApi.ts:17`), not an ad-hoc fetch. `runGuardedCommand`/`rewardBundle` are CORRECTLY omitted —
  a read-only presentational panel ("no actions/buttons", `WorldEventsPanel.tsx:15`) has no
  command-submit or reward surface to use them on; importing them would be dead code.
- **No duplicated guard/command/lit/reward logic** — the only new code is presentational (a 3-entry
  `SEVERITY_BADGE` map, a 5-entry `assetGlyphs` `asset_ref → emoji` map, thin per-RPC api wrappers,
  discriminated-union types shaped so the shared `isServerLit` narrows cleanly). Guard/lit logic lives
  once in the shared lib and is called, never inlined.
- **Fails closed with the server as sole control** — `WorldEventsPanel.tsx:61` renders `null` unless
  `isServerLit(result)` AND events exist; transport errors collapse to `{ok:false}` → also `null`. The
  mount (`GalaxyMapScreen.tsx:167–169`) passes ONLY a `lifecycleKey` re-fetch trigger — no client-side
  feature flag. Dark → the server empties the feed → the panel renders nothing (production UI unchanged).
- **Zero shims** — grep for `shim|compat|TODO|FIXME|HACK|temporary|transitional` across both feature
  dirs returns no matches. (The one sanctioned port-entry shim belongs to a different feature, not this
  surface.)

**Audit 3 — Verifier `scripts/verify-phase20-polish.mjs` + `package.json` — CLEAN (props 1/2/4 PASS,
prop 3 correct N/A).**
- **Imports the shared harness, zero inline copies** — `:28–29` import `teardownVerifier`
  (`verifier-teardown.mjs:18`) + `Abort`/`createReporter`/`createUserFactory`/`resolveEnv`
  (`verify-harness.mjs:46,50,62,36`). Grep of the verifier for locally-redefined harness functions →
  none; the only local helper is the one-line read-only `cfgVal` (`:44`).
- **Strictly dark-posture** — never writes `game_config`, never flips `phase20_polish_enabled`, and
  exercises NO lit path; assertions prove only the LOCK (gate reads `'false'` `:57–58`; read surfaces
  return `ok:true` + empty while dark `:68–70,:78–80`; writers denied to authenticated + anon with
  VALID-shaped args `:91–106`; table SELECT/INSERT denied `:113–147`). Lit-path checks are explicitly
  deferred to the human owner's activation checklist (`:17–20`).
- **Single clean npm entry** — `package.json:51` `"verify:phase20-polish": "node scripts/verify-phase20-polish.mjs"`
  (grep count = 1; no duplicate/stale line).
- **No Phase-20 shell proof exists** — grep for `phase20|world_event|ui_asset` across `scripts/*.sh`
  finds nothing; none was invented and `trade-proof-lib.sh` is untouched.

**Outcome — NO change warranted.** The tree is clean; NO code, migration, flag, or `src/` behavior
change was made. `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` is INTENTIONALLY UNTOUCHED because this cleanup changed no
architectural fact — no table, writer, constraint, or cross-system edge was added, dropped, or altered
(the slice-verifier precedent: a doc-sync is required only when an architectural fact changes). This
entry is the sole artifact of the milestone.

**Preserved human gates (nothing activated by this loop):** `phase20_polish_enabled` and every
Phase-11–20 master flag remain seeded `'false'` (untouched); migrations `0001–0142` are unedited
(forward-only); NO `game_config` write; NO lit-path DB run; NO cron scheduled; `main` untouched; no
merge / deploy / production-apply / workflow-dispatch. **SAFE FOR HUMAN MERGE REVIEW** — activation
(flag flip, deploy, event publish/cron) remains the human owner's decision.

---

## 2026-07-04 — PHASE20-POLISH SLICE 7 (FINAL) — the dark-posture verifier `verify-phase20-polish.mjs` + `verify:phase20-polish`; **Phase 20 CLOSED**

**Request.** Phase 20 final slice: ONE new verify script (the `verify-world-balance.mjs` analogue) +
one `package.json` line + same-step doc-sync + phase close. NO migration change, NO flag write, NO
lit-path DB run, NO `src/`, NO new RPC, NO cron, no git.

**Work done — `scripts/verify-phase20-polish.mjs`** (mirrors `verify-world-balance.mjs`
point-for-point; ZERO inline harness copies — imports the shared `Abort`/`resolveEnv`/`createReporter`/
`createUserFactory` from `scripts/lib/verify-harness.mjs` + `teardownVerifier` from
`scripts/lib/verifier-teardown.mjs`, the same `admin`/`anon`/throwaway-user/`cfgVal` scaffold, the same
`.catch/.finally` teardown with NO flag entry passed — this verifier touches no flag; `emailPrefix`
`'phase20'`). Proves migrations `0139–0142` ship exactly as built and fully dark, with anon/authenticated
clients only. Five assertion groups (`String()` storage-form-tolerant compares; VALID-shaped uuid/arg
sets so a denial proves the LOCK, not argument validation):
1. **Config presence** (READ-ONLY) — `phase20_polish_enabled='false'` (the dark master gate).
2. **Read surfaces dark + ACL-correct** — as AUTHENTICATED: `get_world_events({p_location_id:null,
   p_zone_id:null})` → `ok:true` with an EMPTY `events` array, and `get_ui_asset_catalog({p_asset_kind:
   null})` → `ok:true` with an EMPTY `assets` array (flag-gated fail-closed → empty while dark). As
   ANON: BOTH RPCs DENIED (granted to `authenticated` only).
3. **World Events writers locked** — `world_events_publish` (full valid-shaped arg set) and
   `world_events_set_active({p_event_id:randomUUID(), p_is_active:false})` DENIED to BOTH authenticated
   and anon (service-role-only ACL, 0140).
4. **`world_events` server-only** — authenticated + anon SELECT DENIED (no client read policy/grant); a
   direct authenticated INSERT DENIED (sole writers are its two owner functions).
5. **`ui_asset_catalog` server-only, still static** — authenticated + anon SELECT DENIED; a direct
   authenticated INSERT DENIED (static Reference/Config, seed-migration-only, no runtime writer added).

**`package.json`** — ONE line added adjacent to `verify:world-balance`:
`"verify:phase20-polish": "node scripts/verify-phase20-polish.mjs"`.

**NO-FLAG-WRITE / NO-LIT-PATH stance** (verbatim from the `verify-world-balance` precedent): the script
NEVER writes `game_config` and NEVER flips `phase20_polish_enabled`; it exercises NO lit path. Lit-path
verification (flag on a DEV DB → `world_events_publish` a scoped event → `get_world_events` returns it
with its resolved severity icon; retire via `world_events_set_active`) is DEFERRED to the human owner's
activation checklist.

**Doc-sync (this step).** This DEV_LOG entry (incl. the phase-close summary below). `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`
is INTENTIONALLY UNTOUCHED — a verifier script + a `package.json` line add no table/writer/function/edge
(the Phase-15–19 slice-verifier precedent). Per the dark-phase convention (dark phases 11+ carry NO
ROADMAP marker; DEV_LOG is authoritative), `docs/ROADMAP.md` gets NO Phase-20 status marker.

**Verify.** `node --check scripts/verify-phase20-polish.mjs` → parses OK. NOT executed against a DB —
`0139–0142` are dark/undeployed, so a lit run is deferred (above). The ONLY changes this slice are the
new script + the `package.json` line + this DEV_LOG entry. The M2/M3/M4/M4.5 engine tests are unaffected.

### Phase 20 (Polish / expansion — map UI, portraits, icons, events) — CLOSED

**Deliverables (all DARK behind `phase20_polish_enabled='false'`; migrations `0139–0142`, forward-only):**
- **World Events triad** — `0139` schema (`world_events`, server-only, scope↔target CHECK) → `0140`
  service-role idempotent writers (`world_events_publish` / `world_events_set_active`, nullable-unique
  `dedup_key`, retire-not-delete, both dark-gate-first no-op) → `0141` flag-gated fail-closed read
  surface (`get_world_events`, authenticated-only, live+in-scope filter). World Events is a NEW
  downward-LEAF system: writes ONLY `world_events`, grants nothing, reads only the static Map for FK
  validation — no second writer, acyclic.
- **UI asset vocabulary** — `0142` `ui_asset_catalog` (ONE table discriminated by `asset_kind`
  portrait/icon; static Reference/Config, seed-migration-only, NO runtime writer) + `get_ui_asset_catalog`
  (flag-gated fail-closed, authenticated-only).
- **Fail-closed frontend** — `src/features/events/` (the World Events panel on the galaxy map,
  top-center, read-only, renders nothing while dark) + `src/features/assets/` (the icon resolver +
  client glyph registry) consuming `get_ui_asset_catalog('icon')` for severity icons — so the `0142`
  catalog has a live consumer. Server (flag gate + live-window filter) is the sole visibility control.
- **Portraits** — delivered as DARK seed-ahead vocabulary (`ui_asset_catalog` portrait rows) pending
  their live host (captains, itself dark/unsurfaced) — the accepted Phase-6 `support_craft_types`
  seed-ahead pattern, NOT speculative UI.
- **Verifier** — `verify-phase20-polish` (dark posture, shared harness, no lit path).

**Preserved human gates (nothing activated by this loop):** `phase20_polish_enabled` stays `'false'`;
every Phase-11–20 capability flag remains `'false'`; migrations `0001–0138` untouched (forward-only —
Phase 20 is `0139–0142`); NO `game_config` write; NO lit-path DB run; NO cron scheduled; `main`
untouched; NO merge / deploy / production-apply / workflow-dispatch. Activation (flag flip on a DEV DB,
lit verification, deploy) is the human owner's decision. **SAFE FOR HUMAN MERGE REVIEW.**

## 2026-07-04 — PHASE20-POLISH SLICE 6 — icon resolver (`src/features/assets/`) + severity icons on the World Events panel, fail-closed

**Request.** Wire `ui_asset_catalog` into the World Events panel as SEVERITY ICONS — delivering the
"icons" polish with a real consumer so `get_ui_asset_catalog`/`ui_asset_catalog` (0142) are not a
dead backend surface. Frontend-only: new `src/features/assets/*` + the extended `WorldEventsPanel.tsx`
+ a DEV_LOG entry. No migration, no flag, no cron, no git.

**Design decision (self-approved).** The STEP-4 split holds: the SERVER owns the icon VOCABULARY
(`severity_info`/`severity_warning`/`severity_critical` keys + display metadata + stable `asset_ref`);
the CLIENT owns the rendered GLYPH per `asset_ref` (a tiny inline-emoji registry — the "files" side,
ZERO binary assets). This is the intended architecture, not duplication. The resolver is generic
(`asset_kind`-parameterized) but this slice only CONSUMES `'icon'`; the seeded PORTRAIT rows stay a
server-side vocabulary whose live host (captains) is still dark — a portrait UI consumer remains a
documented seed-ahead deferral (the accepted Phase-6 `support_craft_types` pattern), not speculative UI.

**Work done — new `src/features/assets/`.**
- `assetsTypes.ts` — `UiAsset` (asset_kind `'portrait'|'icon'`, asset_key, display_name, asset_ref,
  category, sort_order) + `GetUiAssetCatalogResult` as a DISCRIMINATED union (`{ok:true; assets?} |
  {ok:false}` — the `isServerLit`-compatible idiom, same reason SLICE 5 used it).
- `assetsApi.ts` — thin `supabase.rpc('get_ui_asset_catalog', { p_asset_kind })` wrapper (the
  explorationApi.ts / eventsApi.ts convention): error → `{ ok:false }`, never throws into render.
- `assetGlyphs.ts` — the client "files" side: a registry mapping each SEEDED icon `asset_ref` (0142) →
  a tiny inline emoji glyph, with an in-file comment stating the split (server owns the key vocabulary;
  this file owns the rendered glyph per `asset_ref`). An unrecognized `asset_ref` → `undefined` → no
  glyph (fail-safe).

**Work done — extended `WorldEventsPanel.tsx` (NOT a new panel).** `refresh()` now fetches both surfaces
together (`Promise.all([getWorldEvents(), getUiAssetCatalog('icon')])`) and stores both; a `useMemo`
builds a `Map<asset_key, UiAsset>` from the returned `'icon'` rows (empty while dark / on a failed read).
Per event, it resolves `severity_${event.severity}` → its `UiAsset` → the glyph via
`assetGlyphs[asset.asset_ref]`, rendered next to the title with the asset's `display_name` as
`title`/`aria-label`. The existing severity badge stays; the icon augments it. FAIL CLOSED is unchanged
(`if (!isServerLit(result) || (result.events?.length ?? 0) === 0) return null`); any icon miss
(dark/empty catalog, unseeded key, unregistered `asset_ref`) renders the event with NO glyph — never
breaks the feed.

**Doc-sync (this step).** This DEV_LOG entry. `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` needs NO change — another
client read-only consumer adds no table, no writer, no cross-system call-edge (it just calls the
already-documented `get_ui_asset_catalog` RPC). Stated explicitly so the omission is intentional.

**Verify.** `npm run build` (tsc -b + vite build) — **GREEN** (156 modules, +2 for `src/features/assets/*`;
typecheck clean; only the pre-existing >500 kB chunk-size advisory, unrelated). Touched ONLY
`src/features/assets/*` (new) + `WorldEventsPanel.tsx` (extended) + this DEV_LOG entry — no migration, no
flag, no cron, no git. `phase20_polish_enabled` remains `'false'` and untouched. The M2/M3/M4/M4.5 engine
tests are backend and unaffected by a fail-closed presentational panel. No lit DB run — while dark the
icon catalog is empty (no glyph resolves) and the feed is empty anyway (panel renders nothing); the
`0142` catalog now has a live consumer only once the human lights the flag and publishes events. Nothing
deployed, `main` untouched.

## 2026-07-04 — PHASE20-POLISH SLICE 5 — the World Events display feature (`src/features/events/`) wired into the galaxy map, fail-closed

**Request.** The "events polish" — a read-only World Events overlay on the galaxy map, fail-closed,
build-verified. Frontend-only: new `src/features/events/*` + the `GalaxyMapScreen.tsx` mount + a
DEV_LOG entry. No migration, no flag, no cron, no git.

**Design decision (self-approved).** The panel renders NOTHING when there are no active events. Because
`get_world_events` (0141) returns `{ok:true, events:[]}` while dark (the flag gate empties the feed
server-side), an empty feed → nothing rendered → today's production UI is byte-unchanged; when the human
later lights `phase20_polish_enabled` AND publishes events, they appear. The server (flag gate +
live-window filter) is the SOLE control; the client never decides visibility. This slice builds ONLY the
events display (single responsibility). Icons-from-the-asset-catalog is the NEXT slice; portraits stay a
server-side vocabulary with no speculative UI (their live host — captains — is itself dark/unsurfaced,
so building portrait UI now would be speculative — deferred).

**Work done — new `src/features/events/`.**
- `eventsTypes.ts` — `WorldEvent` (id, event_type, scope, zone_id, location_id, title, body, severity
  `'info'|'warning'|'critical'`, starts_at, ends_at) + `GetWorldEventsResult`.
- `eventsApi.ts` — thin `supabase.rpc('get_world_events', { p_location_id: null, p_zone_id: null })`
  wrapper (the `explorationApi.ts` convention): on a transport/DB error resolves to the normalized
  fail-closed `{ ok:false }` — never throws into the render path. This minimal cut requests
  GLOBAL-scope events only (nulls) — always map-relevant, no coupling to selected-location state.
- `WorldEventsPanel.tsx` — mirrors `ExplorationPanel`: a `lifecycleKey` re-fetch trigger,
  `useActivityPanelGuards()` mounted guard, `refresh()` on mount / `lifecycleKey` change. FAIL CLOSED:
  `if (!isServerLit(result) || (result.events?.length ?? 0) === 0) return null` — renders nothing while
  dark (empty) or with no live events. When events exist, a compact READ-ONLY overlay (no actions/
  buttons — purely presentational) lists each event's `title`, optional `body`, and a `severity`-styled
  badge (info/warning/critical color classes — the ExplorationPanel badge idiom). Positioned TOP-CENTER,
  clear of the four existing overlays (PortNav top-left, DockServices top-right, Exploration/Mining
  bottom-left, Stop bottom-right). `data-testid="world-events-panel"` + per-event/-badge testids.
- Wired into `GalaxyMapScreen.tsx` in the same overlay block as `ExplorationPanel`/`MiningPanel`, with
  the SAME `lifecycleKey` expression the siblings use, and the same server-driven-visibility comment.

**Deviation from the brief (reported).** `GetWorldEventsResult` is a DISCRIMINATED union
(`{ok:true; events?} | {ok:false}`) rather than the brief's flat `{ ok:boolean; events? }`. A flat shape
makes the shared `isServerLit()` guard's `Extract<T,{ok:true}>` narrow to `never` (fragile render
types); the union is exactly the `explorationTypes.ts` idiom the brief told me to mirror, so the exact
fail-closed line compiles to clean types. Runtime shape and behavior are identical.

**Doc-sync (this step).** This DEV_LOG entry. `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` needs NO change — a client
read-only consumer adds no table, no writer, and no cross-system call-edge (it just calls the already-
documented `get_world_events` RPC). Stated explicitly here so the omission is intentional, not missed.

**Verify.** `npm run build` (tsc -b + vite build) — **GREEN** (154 modules transformed, typecheck
clean; only the pre-existing >500 kB chunk-size advisory, unrelated). Touched ONLY `src/features/events/*`
(new) + `GalaxyMapScreen.tsx` (mount) + this DEV_LOG entry — no migration, no flag, no cron, no git.
`phase20_polish_enabled` remains `'false'` and untouched. The M2/M3/M4/M4.5 engine tests are backend and
unaffected by a fail-closed presentational panel. No lit DB run — the panel renders nothing until the
human lights the flag and publishes events; nothing deployed, `main` untouched.

---

## 2026-07-04 — PHASE20-POLISH SLICE 4 — the UI asset-key vocabulary `ui_asset_catalog` (static reference table + seed) + its flag-gated read surface `get_ui_asset_catalog(...)` (`0142`)

**Request.** The portrait/icon Reference catalog — the server-authoritative asset-key vocabulary the
Phase-20 frontend polish will render. ONE forward-only migration + same-step doc-sync. No flag flipped,
no `src/`, no verifier/`package.json` change, no cron, no shipped-migration edit, no git.

**Design decision (self-approved).** ONE static reference table `ui_asset_catalog` discriminated by
`asset_kind ('portrait'|'icon')`, NOT two near-identical parallel tables — portraits and icons share
the same shape (key → display metadata → asset ref), so a single leaf catalog avoids a duplicated
parallel system (DRY / no-spaghetti; a future third kind is an additive CHECK change, not a new table).
Server-owned VOCABULARY, frontend-owned FILES: server rows reference a stable `asset_key` (e.g.
`world_events.severity 'critical'` → an icon key; a future captain → a portrait key); the image files +
key→file resolution live in the FRONTEND (`asset_ref` = the stable identifier the client resolves).
Pure static leaf: SEED-ONLY, NO runtime writer (edited only by forward-only seed migrations, like the
static Map — no sole-writer function, no second writer anywhere), references nothing, exposed only
through a flag-gated fail-closed read RPC so the ENTIRE Phase-20 surface stays uniformly dark.

**Work done — `0142_phase20_ui_asset_catalog.sql` (forward-only; edits NO shipped migration
`0001–0141`).**
- **(a) Table.** `ui_asset_catalog`: `asset_kind` (`portrait`/`icon` CHECK), `asset_key`, PK
  `(asset_kind, asset_key)`, `display_name`, `asset_ref` (stable frontend identifier — not a file
  path/binary), `category`, `sort_order` default 0, `is_active` default true (retire without deleting),
  `created_at`/`updated_at`. SERVER-ONLY (the 0103 `mining_fields` / 0139 `world_events` posture): RLS
  enabled, `revoke all … from public, anon, authenticated` — no client read, no client write, NO
  runtime writer.
- **(b) Seed** (`on conflict (asset_kind, asset_key) do nothing`; minimal, no bloat): five icons —
  `severity_info`/`severity_warning`/`severity_critical` (pairing with `world_events.severity`) +
  `event_notice`/`event_world_state`; three portraits — `captain_default`/`captain_veteran`/
  `faction_pirate`. `asset_ref` values are stable frontend identifiers (e.g. `icon.severity.critical`),
  not file paths.
- **(c) `get_ui_asset_catalog(p_asset_kind text default null)` → `jsonb`**, `stable security definer`,
  `set search_path = public`, reusing the exact 0141 fail-closed envelope: while
  `phase20_polish_enabled=false` → return `{ok:true, assets:[]}` WITHOUT reading the table; enabled →
  active rows (`is_active`), optionally filtered by `p_asset_kind` when non-null, ordered
  `(asset_kind, sort_order, asset_key)`. ACL `revoke … from public, anon; grant … to authenticated` —
  read-only, no write path.

**Boundary discipline.** `ui_asset_catalog` is Reference/Config (seed-migration only, no runtime writer,
no sole-writer function) — no second writer anywhere. `get_ui_asset_catalog` reads ONLY its own table +
the master flag and references nothing → a pure downward leaf, no new cross-system call-edge, acyclic;
grants nothing, writes nothing.

**Doc-sync (this step).** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`: §1 gains `ui_asset_catalog` under Reference/Config
(seed-migration only, NO runtime writer; server-only read); §2 gains a **UI Assets** read-leaf exposing
`get_ui_asset_catalog` (flag-gated → empty while dark; authenticated-only; reads only its own table +
the flag; references nothing → pure leaf). Folded in the one-line doc-consistency fix noted last review:
the World Events §2 version tag bumped `(0139/0140)` → `(0139/0140/0141)`, and the §1 `world_events`
read-access cell updated from "future read RPC" to the now-shipped `get_world_events` (0141). This
DEV_LOG entry.

**Retirement.** None — a permanent static catalog + permanent read surface. `phase20_polish_enabled`
remains the permanent Phase-20 master gate (retires only on human activation).

**Posture / gates.** Flips NO flag — `phase20_polish_enabled` still `'false'` and untouched (the read
RPC only reads it to gate); edits no `0001–0141`; table has NO client policy and NO runtime writer
(seed block only); the read RPC is granted to `authenticated` only (no anon/public execute, no
write/insert path); no `src/`, no cron, no git. Backend-only and dark/undeployed, so **no lit DB run** —
a lit apply proving dark→empty and enabled→seeded-vocabulary is the human owner's activation-checklist
job (run with the flag flipped on a DEV DB). The M2/M3/M4/M4.5 engine tests are unaffected — no engine
path reads `ui_asset_catalog` or calls `get_ui_asset_catalog`.

---

## 2026-07-04 — PHASE20-POLISH SLICE 3 — the World Events flag-gated READ surface `get_world_events(...)` (fail-closed, authenticated-only) (`0141`)

**Request.** The consumer of `world_events` — the flag-gated, fail-closed client READ surface — after
the producer (`0140`), mirroring the command→read-surface order. ONE forward-only migration + same-step
doc-sync. No flag flipped, no `src/`, no verifier/`package.json` change, no cron, no shipped-migration
edit, no git.

**Design decision (self-approved).** `get_world_events(p_location_id, p_zone_id)` takes the display
context as PARAMETERS the client already holds from the map, rather than resolving the player's ship
position server-side. World events are PUBLIC presentational world info (no per-player secret, no cheat
vector — unlike the hidden `exploration_sites`/`mining_fields` that MUST resolve server-side), so a
parameterized read keeps World Events a PURE downward LEAF: it reads ONLY its own `world_events` table +
the `phase20_polish_enabled` master flag, adding NO cross-system call-edge to Main-Ship/Presence. The
server stays authoritative over WHAT IS SHOWN (the flag gate + `is_active` + the active-time-window),
the only authority that matters for presentational info.

**Work done — `0141_phase20_world_events_read_surface.sql` (forward-only; edits NO shipped migration
`0001–0140`).** `get_world_events(p_location_id uuid default null, p_zone_id uuid default null)` →
`jsonb`, `stable security definer`, `set search_path = public` (reads the RLS-locked, client-revoked
`world_events` and returns curated rows). Reuses the exact 0087/0101/0106 read-surface convention (jsonb
`{ok, events:[...]}` envelope — no new convention):
- **Fail-closed FIRST.** `if not coalesce(cfg_bool('phase20_polish_enabled'), false)` → return
  `{ok:true, events:[]}` immediately, WITHOUT reading the table (the server-rejected-while-dark proof;
  the read-side consumer of the master flag). World events are public presentational info, so the dark
  answer is an empty list (frontend renders nothing), not a reject envelope.
- **Live + in-scope filter (enabled).** Returns only rows that are BOTH currently LIVE (`is_active` AND
  `starts_at <= now()` AND (`ends_at is null` OR `ends_at > now()`)) AND IN SCOPE (`scope='global'`
  always; `scope='zone'` only when `zone_id = p_zone_id`; `scope='location'` only when
  `location_id = p_location_id`). Presentational columns only (id, event_type, scope, zone_id,
  location_id, title, body, severity, starts_at, ends_at). Deterministic order: severity rank
  (critical → warning → info) then `starts_at desc`.
- **ACL.** `revoke execute … from public, anon; grant execute … to authenticated;` (the map/dashboard
  are behind auth — the 0087/0101/0106 auth-guarded read idiom). No write path is exposed.

**Boundary discipline.** World Events stays a downward LEAF: `get_world_events` reads ONLY `world_events`
+ the master flag and writes nothing; the client passes its display context, so NO new cross-system
call-edge is introduced (no Main-Ship/Presence ship-position resolve). Acyclic; grants nothing.

**Doc-sync (this step).** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`: §2 World Events row gains `get_world_events` under
"exposes" (read-only, flag-gated → empty while dark; reads only `world_events` + the master flag; client
passes display context so no new call-edge; still a downward leaf). This DEV_LOG entry.

**Retirement.** None — a permanent read surface. `phase20_polish_enabled` remains the permanent Phase-20
master gate (retires only on human activation).

**Posture / gates.** Flips NO flag — `phase20_polish_enabled` still `'false'` and untouched (this RPC
only reads it to gate); edits no `0001–0140`; granted to `authenticated` only (no anon/public execute,
no write/insert path); no `src/`, no cron, no git. Backend-only and dark/undeployed, so **no lit DB
run** — a lit apply proving dark→empty and enabled→live+in-scope filtering is the human owner's
activation-checklist job (run with the flag flipped on a DEV DB). The M2/M3/M4/M4.5 engine tests are
unaffected — no engine path calls `get_world_events`.

---

## 2026-07-04 — PHASE20-POLISH SLICE 2 — the World Events sole-writer functions `world_events_publish` / `world_events_set_active` (service-role, idempotent) + the `dedup_key` idempotency column (`0140`)

**Request.** Give `world_events` its promised sole writer (the producer) BEFORE the read surface (the
consumer), mirroring the established command→read-surface order. ONE forward-only migration + same-step
doc-sync. No flag flipped, no `src/`, no verifier/`package.json` change, no cron, no shipped-migration
edit, no git.

**Design decision (self-approved).** The writer is **service-role-only** (SECURITY DEFINER,
client-revoked, granted only to `service_role` — the 0021/0135 lockdown). That keeps World Events
server-authoritative and structurally forbids any player-to-player event injection — there is NO client
publish path, so events can never be a PvP / player-interaction vector (Online Presence & Visibility v1
stays deferred). Idempotent via a nullable-unique `dedup_key`: a retried publish with the same key
returns the EXISTING event id, never a duplicate (the idempotent-command law); a NULL key = an ad-hoc,
non-deduplicated event (a permanent optional key, not a shim). Retirement is a status flip
(`is_active=false`), never a delete (no destructive cleanup).

**Work done — `0140_phase20_world_events_writer.sql` (forward-only; edits NO shipped migration
`0001–0139`).**
- **(a) Idempotency storage.** `alter table public.world_events add column dedup_key text;` + a partial
  unique index `world_events_dedup_key_uidx … (dedup_key) where dedup_key is not null` (idempotency
  ONLY over non-null keys — unlimited ad-hoc events coexist).
- **(b) `world_events_publish(...)` → uuid** — SECURITY DEFINER, `set search_path = public`; THE sole
  insert path. Validates (raises on violation, the leaf-writer exception idiom since it returns a bare
  uuid) `event_type`/`scope`/`severity` membership + the scope↔target invariant, mirroring the 0139
  CHECKs exactly, and that a supplied `zone_id`/`location_id` exists (a DOWNWARD read of the static Map
  — the already-noted relationship, no new edge). Idempotent: a non-null `dedup_key` uses
  `insert … on conflict (dedup_key) where dedup_key is not null do nothing returning id` with a
  fallback select of the existing id; a NULL key always inserts a fresh event.
- **(c) `world_events_set_active(event_id, is_active)` → void** — SECURITY DEFINER; flips `is_active` +
  bumps `updated_at`; the retire/reactivate path, NEVER a delete.
- **(d) ACL lockdown.** `revoke execute … from public, anon, authenticated; grant execute … to
  service_role;` for BOTH functions — service-role only, never clients.

**Deviation from the STEP-2 brief (reported).** Both writers gate on `phase20_polish_enabled` FIRST and
no-op while false (publish → returns NULL; set_active → returns without writing), BEFORE any validation
or write. The brief did not enumerate this gate; I added it because SLICE 1's shipped `0139` flag
description commits that "any future World Events writer/processor must no-op" while false — omitting the
gate would leave that shipped law text contradicting the code (a defect per the engineering principles).
It is also the pervasive reject-before-any-read idiom (`location_investment_invest:74–78`), is strictly
more conservative (darker), and does not change the enabled-path publish/dedup/set_active behavior the
brief specified. The planner's "service-role-only alone keeps it dark" rationale (forbidding the
PvP-injection vector) is fully compatible with also gating.

**Boundary discipline.** `world_events` now has its concrete sole writers (`world_events_publish` /
`world_events_set_active`) — one write path per table, no second writer. World Events stays a downward
LEAF: the ONLY cross-system access is a DOWNWARD read of the static Map (`zones`/`locations`) to
validate a supplied FK target — no NEW call-edge, acyclic; it writes ONLY `world_events` and grants no
rewards (one-directional pipeline law).

**Doc-sync (this step).** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`: §1 `world_events` sole writer updated from "its
own future function" to the concrete `world_events_publish` / `world_events_set_active` (service-role
only; idempotent via `dedup_key`; retire-not-delete); §2 World Events row records both functions, the
dark-gate-first no-op, the Map-FK downward read, and the no-client-path / no-delete forbiddens. This
DEV_LOG entry.

**Retirement.** None new. `dedup_key` NULL-means-ad-hoc is a permanent optional key, not a shim.
`phase20_polish_enabled` remains the permanent Phase-20 master gate (retires only on human activation).

**Posture / gates.** Flips NO flag — `phase20_polish_enabled` still `'false'` and untouched; edits no
`0001–0139`; no client grant on either function (service-role only); no `src/`, no cron, no git.
Backend-only and dark/undeployed, so **no lit DB run** — a lit apply proving publish-then-dedup (same
key → same id, no duplicate) and `set_active` (retire/reactivate, no delete) is the human owner's
activation-checklist job (run with the flag flipped on a DEV DB). The M2/M3/M4/M4.5 engine tests are
unaffected — no engine path calls these service-role functions or reads `world_events`.

---

## 2026-07-04 — PHASE20-POLISH SLICE 1 — the Phase-20 dark master flag `phase20_polish_enabled` + the World Events schema `world_events` (`0139`)

**Request.** Phase 20 (Polish / expansion — map UI, portraits, icons, events; ROADMAP :95) first build
slice: ONE forward-only migration seeding the dark master flag + creating the World Events foundation
table, with same-step doc-sync. No flag flipped, no `src/`, no verifier/`package.json` change, no cron,
no shipped-migration edit, no git.

**Design decision (self-approved, grounded in the docs).** **World Events is a NEW server-authoritative
downward-LEAF system**, the sole writer of its own `world_events` table — presentational, timed world
happenings (a "pirate surge in Zone X" notice, a seasonal banner, a world-state highlight) that the map
/ dashboard will READ (via a later flag-gated read RPC) to satisfy Phase 20's "events" polish goal. It
is a PURE leaf honoring the one-directional pipeline law (ROADMAP standing law 3): it NEVER writes
`zone_state`/`location_state` (World State's tables — so it is NOT a second writer to World State),
`fleets`/`combat_*`/`reward_grants`, or any other system's table, and it grants no rewards; it only
READS the static Map (`zones`/`locations`) for FK integrity. Nothing depends on writing it. It is
fail-closed and server-only — no client read/write path this slice; a later slice adds ONE flag-gated
read RPC (the only client path) and later still a service-role writer to publish/expire events.

**Work done — `0139_phase20_world_events_flag_and_schema.sql` (forward-only; edits NO shipped
migration `0001–0138`).**
- **(a) Config.** Seeds the Phase-20 dark master flag `phase20_polish_enabled='false'` (`on conflict
  (key) do nothing`). Every Phase-20 read surface must gate on this FIRST and return nothing while
  false; any future writer/processor no-ops while false. NOT flipped true.
- **(b) Schema.** Creates `public.world_events`: `id uuid pk`, `event_type` (`notice`/`world_state`/
  `seasonal` CHECK), polymorphic `scope` (`global`/`zone`/`location` CHECK) with nullable `zone_id`→
  `zones(id)` / `location_id`→`locations(id)` (Map FK targets, `on delete cascade`) and a CHECK
  enforcing the scope↔target invariant (global ⇒ both null; zone ⇒ zone_id set & location_id null;
  location ⇒ location_id set & zone_id null), `title`/`body`, `severity` (`info`/`warning`/`critical`
  default `info`), `is_active` default true (retire without deleting — no destructive cleanup),
  `starts_at`/`ends_at` (null = open-ended), `created_at`/`updated_at`. Indexes: active-window
  `(is_active, starts_at desc)` + partial `zone_id`/`location_id` scoped-lookup indexes.
- **Fail-closed posture (the 0103 `mining_fields` / `market_offers` server-only idiom).** RLS enabled
  with NO client policy and `revoke all … from public, anon, authenticated` — no client read, no client
  write. Sole writer will be World Events' OWN future service-role function; no runtime writer exists
  this slice and no other system writes this table.

**Boundary discipline.** One sole writer per table (`world_events` → World Events, deferred to its own
future writer — the 0128/0103 schema-first idiom). Downward LEAF: no new cross-system CALL edge exists
yet (no function is created here); the only relationship is the read-only Map FK. Acyclic and no second
writer to any table — World Events never writes World State's `zone_state`/`location_state`.

**Doc-sync (this step).** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`: §1 ownership matrix gains the `world_events` row
under a NEW **World Events** system (sole writer = its own future service-role writer; server-only, no
client surface; DARK behind `phase20_polish_enabled`); §2 gains the World-Events contract row (owns
`world_events`; a downward leaf — reads only the static Map for FK integrity; writes nothing else;
grants nothing; no client surface yet). No call-edge invented (none exists yet). This DEV_LOG entry.

**Retirement / activation.** `phase20_polish_enabled` is a permanent capability gate (the Phase-20
master flag), not a transitional shim — it retires only when the human owner activates Phase 20.

**Posture / gates.** Ships the flag `'false'` — NOT flipped; edits no `0001–0138`; touches no `src/`,
no other flag, no cron, no git. Backend-only and dark/undeployed, so **no lit DB run** — a lit run
(apply `0139` on a DEV DB, confirm the flag is false, the table exists server-only, no client
read/write) is the human owner's activation-checklist job. The M2/M3/M4/M4.5 engine tests are
unaffected by a new dark, server-only table (no engine path reads or writes `world_events`).

## 2026-07-04 — WORLD-BALANCE-P19 CLEANUP — restore the `0092` docked-resolve dedup that `0136` regressed; re-route all three Trade Market RPCs through `mainship_resolve_docked_location` (`0138`)

**Request.** Act on the highest-priority world-economy cleanup finding (F1 from the baseline audit) with
ONE new forward-only migration + same-step doc-sync. No flag write, no `src/`, no verifier/`package.json`
change, no shipped-migration edit, no git.

**Bug (F1 — duplication regression in `0136`).** Migration `0092` (trade_market_1) had extracted the
copy-pasted ~10-line "resolve docked location" block (`mainship_space_validate_context` → require
`at_location` → read the present/location fleet's `current_location_id`) into ONE shared read-only helper
`public.mainship_resolve_docked_location(ship)` and repointed all three Trade Market RPCs to it. But
`0136` (price drift) rebuilt `get_market_offers` / `market_buy` / `market_sell` from the STALE pre-`0092`
bodies (`0087`/`0089`/`0090`) to add the `trade_effective_price` price composition — and in doing so
**re-inlined** the docked block into all three (`0136:295–305`, `376–384`, `472–480`) and re-declared the
`v_ctx jsonb` local `0092` had dropped. That silently reverted the dedup (the SAME non-trivial logic in
three places again) and orphaned the helper from the trade path (it stayed in use only by `0133`).

**Fix — `0138_world_balance_p19_trade_docked_helper_reuse.sql` (forward-only; edits NO shipped
migration).** `create or replace`s the three functions to the EXACT `0136` bodies, changing ONLY:
(a) each re-inlined docked block → `v_loc := public.mainship_resolve_docked_location(v_ship);` followed by
the SAME `if v_loc is null then … 'not_docked' … end if;` each already had; and (b) drop the now-unused
`v_ctx jsonb;` local. A line-for-line diff of each function region (`0136` → `0138`) shows ONLY those two
changes per function and nothing else. **BEHAVIOR-IDENTICAL:** both inline null-paths (not `at_location`;
no matching fleet row) already collapsed to one `not_docked` reason, and the helper returns NULL for both,
mapped to the same `not_docked`. Everything else is byte-for-byte `0136`: the dark `trade_market_enabled`
server-reject, `mainship_resolve_owned_ship`, the per-ship `mainship_space_lock_context`, the idempotency
replay, the `trade_effective_price` composition on EVERY price, the receipt writes, and the same
`revoke … from public, anon` / `grant … to authenticated` ACLs.

**Posture / gates.** Adds NO table / column / writer / flag / cross-system edge — the helper and the Trade
Market → Main-Ship read edge already existed and were already documented. The feature stays **DARK** behind
`trade_market_enabled='false'`; this migration flips NO flag and edits no `0001–0137`.

**Doc-sync (this step).** This DEV_LOG entry. `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` needs **no edit**: the Trade-Market
row (line ~89, "the docked-location context (via the shared Main-Ship helper
`mainship_resolve_docked_location`)") and the Main-Ship row (line ~86, "`mainship_resolve_docked_location`
… called DOWNWARD by the Trade Market RPCs") described the INTENDED end-state — `0136` was the drift, and
`0138` makes both statements true of the shipped code again. No remaining contradiction found.

**Retirement.** None — this removes a regression and adds no temporary code. `mainship_resolve_docked_location`
is the permanent single source for docked-location resolution across Trade Market and Location Investment.

**Verify.** Line-for-line diff of each of the three function regions (`0136` → `0138`) confirms the ONLY
differences are the three helper-call substitutions and the three dropped `v_ctx` locals; no other change
leaked in. Not executed against a DB (dark; a lit run is the human owner's activation-checklist job).

## 2026-07-04 — WORLD-BALANCE-P19 SLICE 4 (FINAL) — the dark-posture verifier `verify-world-balance.mjs` + `verify:world-balance`; **Phase 19 CLOSED**

**Request.** Phase 19 final slice: ONE new verify script (the `verify-location-investment.mjs` analogue)
+ one `package.json` line + same-step doc-sync. NO migration change, NO flag write, NO lit-path DB run,
NO `src/`, NO new RPC, NO cron, no git.

**Work done — `scripts/verify-world-balance.mjs`** (mirrors `verify-location-investment.mjs`
point-for-point; ZERO inline harness copies — imports the shared `Abort`/`resolveEnv`/`createReporter`/
`createUserFactory` from `scripts/lib/verify-harness.mjs` + `teardownVerifier` from
`scripts/lib/verifier-teardown.mjs`, the same `admin`/`anon`/throwaway-user/`cfgVal` scaffold, the same
`.catch/.finally` teardown with NO flag entry passed — this verifier touches no flag). Proves migrations
`0135–0137` ship exactly as built and fully dark, with anon/authenticated clients only. Five assertion
groups (CODE/lock-keyed, `String()` storage-form-tolerant compares):
1. **Config presence** (READ-ONLY) — `world_balance_enabled='false'` + all eight tunables at their
   seeded values (`world_balance_defeat_window_seconds='3600'`, `world_balance_price_pressure_coeff='0.5'`,
   `world_balance_price_drift_rate='0.1'`, `world_balance_price_multiplier_min='0.5'`,
   `world_balance_price_multiplier_max='2.0'`, `world_balance_field_depletion_per_extract='0.1'`,
   `world_balance_field_regen_rate='0.02'`, `world_balance_field_reserve_min='0.1'`).
2. **Internal World-State functions locked** — `worldstate_current_price_multiplier`,
   `worldstate_field_remaining`, `worldstate_deplete_field`, and `worldstate_tick` are DENIED to BOTH
   anon and authenticated (service-role-only, `0135–0137`); VALID-shaped uuid args so the denial proves
   the lock, not argument validation.
3. **`mining_field_state` server-only** — anon + authenticated SELECT DENIED (no client policy/grant —
   the `mining_fields` posture), and a direct authenticated INSERT DENIED (no client write path).
4. **`location_state.price_multiplier` dark no-op** — public-readable; every existing row equals `1.0`
   (composition inert while dark); a fresh DB with 0 rows does not fail (the column being selectable is
   the proof).
5. **Static catalogs — no second writer** — `market_offers` + `mining_fields` keep NO client write path
   (direct authenticated INSERT/UPDATE DENIED), confirming Phase 19 added no runtime writer to either
   (drift/depletion live on the World-State-owned `location_state`/`mining_field_state`).

**`package.json`** — one line added adjacent to `verify:location-investment`:
`"verify:world-balance": "node scripts/verify-world-balance.mjs"`.

**Lit-path DEFERRED (the verify-location-investment stance verbatim).** The script NEVER writes
`game_config` / NEVER flips `world_balance_enabled`; it exercises NO lit path. Lit-path verification —
flag on → the tick raises pressure at recently-defeated locations and decays it; drifts
`location_state.price_multiplier` toward the danger-premium target so `trade_effective_price` moves the
charged/paid price in lockstep with the displayed price; depletes `mining_field_state.reserve_fraction`
on each extraction (bundle yield thins, floored) while the tick regenerates it toward 1.0 — is deferred
to the human owner's activation checklist (flip the flag on a DEV database and run the lit checks there,
never here). Because `0135–0137` are not deployed, local verification is
`node --check scripts/verify-world-balance.mjs` only (**parses OK**).

**Doc-sync (same step).** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` INTENTIONALLY UNTOUCHED — a verifier script + a
`package.json` line add no table, writer, function, or cross-system edge (the Phase-15/16/17/18
slice-verifier precedent). Only this DEV_LOG entry is the doc change.

**Phase 19 (World balance / living economy) CLOSED — backend + verifier deliverables:**
- `0135` — PIRATE PRESSURE: wires the `defeat_pressure` seam in `worldstate_tick()` — the pressure
  decay TARGET gains a flag-gated danger term from recent `combat_reports` defeats (read DOWNWARD); the
  dark master flag `world_balance_enabled='false'` + `world_balance_defeat_window_seconds='3600'`.
- `0136` — PRICE DRIFT: the World-State-owned `location_state.price_multiplier` (tick-driven, gated) +
  the read helper `worldstate_current_price_multiplier` + the ONE composition helper
  `trade_effective_price`, routed through all three Trade Market functions (display == charged/paid); no
  runtime writer added to `market_offers`.
- `0137` — FIELD DEPLETION: the World-State-owned `mining_field_state` reserve (lazy rows) +
  `worldstate_field_remaining` (read) + `worldstate_deplete_field` (sole reserve write, NO-SOFTLOCK
  floor) + a gated tick regen, composed into `mining_extract` (bundle scaled by reserve, depleted once
  per real extraction); no runtime writer added to `mining_fields`.
- `verify-world-balance.mjs` — the dark-posture verifier + `verify:world-balance`.

**Human gates preserved.** `world_balance_enabled` stays `'false'` and ALL `world_balance*` dynamics
remain behind it; ALL Phase 11–18 flags remain `'false'`; migrations `0001–0134` untouched
(forward-only — Phase 19 is `0135–0137`); backend-only (no `src/**`); no `game_config` write; no
lit-path DB run; no cron scheduled (the 60s `process_location_state_ticks()` → `worldstate_tick()` path
is reused); no `main` touch; no merge / deploy / production apply / workflow dispatch — activation is the
human owner's decision. SAFE FOR HUMAN MERGE REVIEW.

**Verify.** `node --check scripts/verify-world-balance.mjs` → parses OK. `git status --porcelain` shows
the ONLY changes are the new script + `package.json` + this DEV_LOG entry; no migration,
`SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`, flag, `src/`, or `main` touched. The verifier was NOT executed against a DB (the
gates forbid a lit/production DB run) — dark-posture proof is by `node --check` + the mirrored precedent.

## 2026-07-04 — WORLD-BALANCE-P19 SLICE 3 (FINAL) — RESOURCE-FIELD DEPLETION (dark): World-State `mining_field_state` reserve, composed into `mining_extract`, regenerated by the tick (`0137`)

**Request.** Phase 19 third/final mechanic: resource-field depletion, dark-gated, as ONE coherent
producer+consumer vertical slice — one forward-only migration `0137` + same-step doc-sync, one revertible
commit, nothing dead. No flag flip, no new cron, no `src/`, no git, no edit to any shipped migration.

**Design (self-approved; "world-state owns world-state" + no-second-writer / no-cycle / NO-SOFTLOCK).**
`mining_fields` stays static server-only Reference/Config (NO runtime writer). Depletion is NEW
World-State-owned state — a LAZY per-field reserve — composed with the field's yield at extraction time
and REGENERATED over time by the tick.

**Work done — `0137` (producer + consumer together):**
- **`mining_field_state`** — NEW World-State-owned table (`field_id` PK → `mining_fields`,
  `reserve_fraction numeric default 1.0 check [0,1]`, timestamps). Rows created LAZILY on first
  depletion (upsert) — no seeding, no dead rows; an un-mined field has NO row and reads as full (1.0).
  Server-only (RLS on, no client policy/grant — the `mining_fields` posture). World State is the SOLE
  writer.
- **`worldstate_field_remaining(field)`** — flag-gated read (internal/service-role): 1.0 while dark OR
  when no row, else `reserve_fraction`.
- **`worldstate_deplete_field(field)`** — flag-gated writer (internal/service-role): no-op while dark;
  else upserts `reserve_fraction` down by `world_balance_field_depletion_per_extract`, hard-floored at
  `world_balance_field_reserve_min` (a depleted field never fully dies — NO-SOFTLOCK). THE sole reserve
  write on extraction.
- **`worldstate_tick()` re-created** = the `0136` body verbatim except a gated field-regen pass (step 5):
  when `world_balance_enabled=true`, nudge every `mining_field_state.reserve_fraction` toward 1.0 by
  `world_balance_field_regen_rate` per tick, clamped ≤ 1.0 (touching only not-yet-full rows). While dark
  the block is skipped.
- **`mining_extract` re-created** = the `0104` body verbatim except ONE gated block: inside
  `if cfg_bool('world_balance_enabled')`, read `worldstate_field_remaining(field)` and scale each item
  qty by it with a per-item floor of 1 (`greatest(1, round(qty × reserve))`) BEFORE snapshotting the
  bundle (into a new local `v_bundle`, used in BOTH the row insert and the result envelope), then call
  `worldstate_deplete_field(field)` once. The wrapper `command_mining_extract` is UNCHANGED (it passes
  the writer's `pending_bundle` through).

**Deplete-once placement (verified against the real idempotency structure).** In `mining_extract` the
receipt lookup (step 6) RETURNS on a replay of (ship, request_id) BEFORE the extraction-row insert
(step 12) and the receipt insert (step 13). The reserve read + bundle scale (step 11.5) and the
`worldstate_deplete_field` call (step 12.5) sit in the success path AFTER the row insert — unreachable on
a replay — so depletion fires EXACTLY ONCE per REAL extraction and NEVER on replay (no double-deplete).
Reserve is read BEFORE this extraction's depletion, so the bundle reflects the pre-extraction reserve
(first extraction from a full field yields full, then the field drops to 0.9, etc.).

**Reused vs new config.** Reused (NOT re-seeded): `world_balance_enabled` (0135). New this slice, all
consumed: `world_balance_field_depletion_per_extract='0.1'` (−10%/extraction),
`world_balance_field_regen_rate='0.02'` (~full in ~45 ticks), `world_balance_field_reserve_min='0.1'`
(floor — worked fields thin out but recover and never die).

**Dark-identical invariant (reserve = 1.0 → bundle verbatim + tick untouched; gated in tick, extract,
AND both functions).** With `world_balance_enabled='false'`:
1. **Tick** — the regen pass is entirely inside `if v_wb_enabled`; while dark `mining_field_state` is
   untouched and the `location_state`/`zone_state` logic is byte-for-byte 0136 → a dark tick is
   byte-identical.
2. **`worldstate_field_remaining`** — returns 1.0 while dark regardless of any stored row.
3. **`mining_extract`** — the scale + deplete are entirely inside `if v_wb` (read once via
   `cfg_bool('world_balance_enabled')` only on the success path after the cooldown check); while dark
   `v_bundle = v_field.reward_bundle_json` verbatim and `worldstate_deplete_field` is never called → the
   stored `pending_bundle_json` and the returned envelope are identical to 0104. All early-reject paths
   (dark mining, no field, cooldown) never even read `world_balance_enabled`.
4. **`worldstate_deplete_field`** — no-ops while dark (defense in depth: a stray caller can't deplete).

**New downward edges (acyclic).** Mining → World State: read `worldstate_field_remaining` + call the
writer-function `worldstate_deplete_field` — both DOWNWARD (an activity depending on the world-state
leaf). ACYCLIC: World State never reads or calls Mining. NO new edge into `mining_fields` (still static,
no runtime writer, no second writer). World State stays the SOLE writer of `mining_field_state`; Mining
writes only `mining_extractions` and still deposits ONLY via `Reward.grant('mining', …)`.

**Doc-sync (same step).** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`: §1 new `mining_field_state` row (World State
sole writer, server-only); §2 World State contract (the table + the two functions + tick regen;
"must NOT add a runtime writer to `market_offers` or `mining_fields`"); §2 Mining row (reads
`worldstate_field_remaining` + calls `worldstate_deplete_field` DOWNWARD, scales the bundle while on,
verbatim while dark, never writes `mining_fields`/`mining_field_state`, still deposits only via
`Reward.grant`); §3 a new "Mining → World State field-depletion edges are acyclic" note.
`docs/ROADMAP.md`: Phase-19 row carries no per-phase status marker (dark phases 11+), left UNTOUCHED
(noted per the instruction). **Phase 19's three mechanics (pirate pressure 0135, price drift 0136, field
depletion 0137) are now all implemented DARK.**

**Retirement / activation.** `world_balance_enabled` is the permanent Phase-19 gate. Lit-path
verification (flag on a DEV DB → extract repeatedly → the bundle thins toward the floor while the reserve
upserts down; idle ticks regen it back toward 1.0; a replay never double-depletes) is deferred to the
human's activation checklist. This slice flips NO flag.

**Human gates preserved.** `world_balance_enabled` stays `'false'`; ALL Phase 11–18 flags remain
`'false'`; migrations `0001–0136` untouched (forward-only — `0137` is new); no new cron (reuses the 60s
`process_location_state_ticks()` → `worldstate_tick()` path); backend-only (no `src/**`); no runtime
`game_config` write; no lit-path/production DB run; no `main` touch; no merge/deploy/workflow dispatch.
SAFE FOR HUMAN MERGE REVIEW.

**Verify.** Forward-only: `0137` is a new file; the only changes are `0137`, `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`,
and this DEV_LOG entry — no shipped migration edited. No second writer to `mining_fields` (grep-confirmed:
`0137` never writes it; the only new table writer is World State on `mining_field_state`). The
dark-identical property + the deplete-once-never-on-replay property are established by the logic walk
above against the real 0104 idempotency structure. **The M2–M5 / mining verify suites could NOT be run
locally**: they connect to a live Supabase (service-role key in `.env.local`), which the human gates
forbid and where `0137` is not deployed — so NO green/red claim is made; the dark-safety argument rests
on the logic walk + forward-only proof (the `0132–0136` dark-slice precedent).

## 2026-07-04 — WORLD-BALANCE-P19 SLICE 2 — PRICE DRIFT (dark): World-State price multiplier folded into `location_state`, composed into all three Trade Market prices (`0136`)

**Request.** Phase 19 second mechanic: price drift, dark-gated, as ONE coherent producer+consumer
vertical slice — one forward-only migration `0136` + same-step doc-sync, one revertible commit, nothing
dead. No flag flip, no new cron, no `src/`, no git, no edit to any shipped migration.

**Design (self-approved; "world-state owns world-state" + no-second-writer / no-cycle).**
`market_offers` stays STATIC Reference/Config (NO runtime writer). Price drift is NEW World-State-owned
state FOLDED into the existing `location_state` (the tick already iterates it — no parallel table),
COMPOSED with the static base price at read/transaction time.

**Work done — `0136` (producer + consumer together):**
- **`location_state.price_multiplier`** — ONE new column, `numeric not null default 1.0 check (> 0)`.
  `add column … default 1.0 not null` backfills every existing row to a no-op 1.0. World State stays
  the SOLE writer — only `worldstate_tick` writes it.
- **`worldstate_tick()` re-created** = the `0135` body verbatim except a flag-gated multiplier drift.
  When `world_balance_enabled=true`: the multiplier nudges toward
  `target = 1.0 + world_balance_price_pressure_coeff × clamp((pressure−baseline)/(max−baseline),0,1)`
  by `world_balance_price_drift_rate` per applied tick, hard-clamped to
  `[world_balance_price_multiplier_min, world_balance_price_multiplier_max]` — the STEP-1
  target-based / self-correcting / bounded philosophy, reusing the SAME baseline/max pressure config
  (not duplicated).
- **`worldstate_current_price_multiplier(loc)`** — the World-State read helper (internal/service-role).
  Flag-gated: returns `1.0` while dark regardless of the stored column (the provable dark guarantee),
  else the row's `price_multiplier` (1.0 if no row).
- **`trade_effective_price(base, loc)`** = `greatest(1, round(base × worldstate_current_price_multiplier(loc)))`
  — the ONE shared composition helper (integer credits, ≥1 floor; the round/floor rule decided here
  once). Internal.
- **All three trade functions re-created** = `0087`/`0089`/`0090` verbatim EXCEPT the price read:
  `get_market_offers` composes BOTH displayed prices; `market_buy` composes the charged `sell_price`;
  `market_sell` composes the paid `buy_price`. So DISPLAYED == CHARGED/PAID always — no
  drift-vs-transaction exploit — and the composition lives in exactly ONE place. Docking resolution,
  dark gate, locks, idempotency, and grants are all preserved verbatim.

**Reused vs new config.** Reused (NOT re-seeded): `world_balance_enabled` (0135, the master gate) and
the pressure `baseline`/`max` (0032). New this slice, all consumed: `world_balance_price_pressure_coeff='0.5'`
(up to +50% at max danger), `world_balance_price_drift_rate='0.1'` (10%/tick toward target),
`world_balance_price_multiplier_min='0.5'`, `world_balance_price_multiplier_max='2.0'` (a bounded
premium that breathes, never runs away).

**Dark-identical invariant (multiplier = 1.0 while dark, gated in BOTH the tick and the read helper).**
Two independent guards make the whole slice a no-op while `world_balance_enabled='false'`:
1. **Tick:** the multiplier column is written `price_multiplier = case when v_wb_enabled then v_new_mult
   else price_multiplier end` (the 0135 `last_tick_at` self-assign idiom), and ALL normalized/premium
   math is inside `if v_wb_enabled` — so while dark the column is left untouched at 1.0 and no drift
   math runs. The pressure/danger-modifier/zone-rollup logic is byte-for-byte 0135. So a dark tick's
   writes are identical to pre-slice.
2. **Read helper:** `worldstate_current_price_multiplier` returns 1.0 while dark REGARDLESS of any
   stored value, so `trade_effective_price` = `round(base × 1.0)` = `round(base)` = the base integer
   price. Every composed price (display, charged, paid) equals the pre-slice price. (The base
   `market_offers` prices seed as integers, so `round(base)` is a no-op.)

**New downward edge (acyclic).** Trade Market → World State (read `worldstate_current_price_multiplier`).
ACYCLIC: World State reads only its OWN `location_state` + `combat_reports` (0135) and never reads Trade
Market → no cycle, no two-way dependency. NO new edge into `market_offers` (still static, no runtime
writer, no second writer). World State stays the SOLE writer of `location_state`; Trade Market writes
only `trade_receipts`.

**Doc-sync (same step).** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`: §1 `location_state` row (the new column is
tick-sole-written, dark/no-op); §2 World State contract (the price multiplier + `worldstate_current_price_multiplier`
helper; "must NOT add a runtime writer to `market_offers`"); §2 Trade Market row (base price is now
COMPOSED via the one `trade_effective_price` helper, the "source of ALL offer prices" phrasing corrected
to "BASE offer prices", the new downward read edge, still never writes `market_offers`/`location_state`);
§3 a new "Trade Market → World State price-composition edge is acyclic" note. `docs/ROADMAP.md`: Phase-19
row carries no per-phase status marker (dark phases 11+), left UNTOUCHED (noted per the instruction).

**Retirement / activation.** `world_balance_enabled` is the permanent Phase-19 gate (same as 0135).
Lit-path verification (flag on a DEV DB → drive the tick under danger → the multiplier breathes toward
the bounded target → composed buy/sell prices track it → display == charged/paid) is deferred to the
human's activation checklist. This slice flips NO flag.

**Human gates preserved.** `world_balance_enabled` stays `'false'`; ALL Phase 11–18 flags remain
`'false'`; migrations `0001–0135` untouched (forward-only — `0136` is new); no new cron (reuses the 60s
`process_location_state_ticks()` → `worldstate_tick()` path); backend-only (no `src/**`); no runtime
`game_config` write; no lit-path/production DB run; no `main` touch; no merge/deploy/workflow dispatch.
SAFE FOR HUMAN MERGE REVIEW.

**Verify.** Forward-only: `0136` is a new file; the only changes are `0136`, `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`,
and this DEV_LOG entry — no shipped migration edited. Single-sourced composition: all three trade
functions call `trade_effective_price` (grep-confirmed). The dark-identical property is established by
the two-guard logic walk above. **The M2–M5 / trade verify suites could NOT be run locally**: they
connect to a live Supabase (service-role key in `.env.local`), which the human gates forbid and where
`0136` is not deployed — so NO green/red claim is made; the dark-safety argument rests on the logic walk
+ forward-only proof (the `0132–0135` dark-slice precedent).

## 2026-07-04 — WORLD-BALANCE-P19 SLICE 1 — PIRATE PRESSURE (dark): wire the `defeat_pressure` seam in `worldstate_tick()` (`0135`)

**Request.** Phase 19 first mechanic: pirate pressure, dark-gated, by EXTENDING the existing World
State tick — ONE forward-only migration `0135` + same-step doc-sync. No flag flip, no new cron, no
`src/`, no git, no edit to any shipped migration.

**Design (self-approved, grounded in the STEP-0 recon seam).** Pirate pressure is NOT a new system or
a new column — it is a living reaction on the EXISTING `location_state.pressure` field, delivered by
re-creating the one World State writer `worldstate_tick()`. It finally wires the long-standing
`-- defeat_pressure TODO (M5+): add recent-defeat reads from combat_reports` seam left in the tick
since 0032.

**Work done — `0135`:**
- **`world_balance_enabled`** — NEW dark master flag, seeded `'false'` (`on conflict do nothing`), the
  Phase-19 gate. CONSUMED this slice by the tick (not a dead flag): the danger term is gated on it.
- **`world_balance_defeat_window_seconds`** — NEW tunable, seeded `'3600'` (a one-hour rolling danger
  memory), consumed this slice.
- **Reused, NOT re-seeded:** `worldstate_pressure_defeat_increase` (from 0032) scales the danger term.
- **`worldstate_tick()` re-created** = byte-for-byte the 0034 body EXCEPT the decay TARGET. Old:
  decay toward `baseline`. New: decay toward `baseline + danger_term`, where
  `danger_term = 0` unless `cfg_bool('world_balance_enabled')` is true, in which case
  `danger_term = count(combat_reports at this location with result='defeat' within the window) *
  worldstate_pressure_defeat_increase`.

**Join key (verified from the real schema, not invented).** `combat_reports` (0016) carries
`location_id uuid references public.locations (id)` and `result text` (`report_create` copies the
encounter `status` — `'defeat'` on fleet loss, 0032 — into `result`). So a defeat attributes directly
to its location: `combat_reports.location_id = location_state.location_id`, filtered `result='defeat'`
and `created_at >= now() - window`. Only DEFEATS raise pressure; victories/escapes/completions do not.

**Preserved-while-dark invariant (byte-identical output).** With `world_balance_enabled='false'`:
`v_wb_enabled=false` → the danger-term read is skipped entirely (no `combat_reports` query) →
`v_danger_term=0` → `v_target = v_baseline` → the decay expression becomes
`(v_baseline - v_pressure) * v_decay_rate` — the EXACT 0034 line — minus the identical fleet-relief
term, under the IDENTICAL `least(v_max, greatest(v_min, …))` cap. Reconcile/danger-modifier/zone-rollup
are untouched from 0034. So a dark tick produces the same `pressure`/`danger_modifier`/`active_fleets`
writes as today: self-correcting toward baseline, no accumulation, pressure never exceeds
`worldstate_pressure_max`. When the flag is on, the term is a decay TARGET (not an accumulator), so it
is self-correcting too — as defeats age out of the window the target falls back to baseline and pressure
decays back down, always bounded by the same cap.

**New downward read edge (acyclic).** `worldstate_tick()` now READS `combat_reports` DOWNWARD (history,
read-only) — a NEW edge World State → Report. ACYCLIC: Report writes only `combat_reports` and calls
nothing (0016), so it cannot call back. World State still writes ONLY `location_state`/`zone_state` and
never fleets/combat/rewards. This mirrors Combat's pre-existing downward READ of
`location_state.danger_modifier` (0032), just the other direction into finalized history — not a read of
active state (Report stays never-a-source-of-truth-for-active-state).

**Doc-sync (same step).** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`: §2 World State contract row updated (target =
baseline + gated danger term; the downward `combat_reports` read; dark/no-op posture; "must NOT write
`combat_reports`"); §3 `process_location_state_ticks()` cron note + a new World State forbidden-edges
line recording the acyclic downward read. `docs/ROADMAP.md`: the Phase-19 row carries no per-phase
status column (it is a plain scope cell), so it is left UNTOUCHED this slice (noted here per the
instruction).

**Retirement / activation.** `world_balance_enabled` is a permanent capability gate (the Phase-19
master flag), not a transitional shim — it "retires" only when the human owner activates Phase 19.
Lit-path verification (flag on a DEV DB → seed a `'defeat'` report at a location → run
`worldstate_tick()` → pressure rises toward `baseline + term`, bounded by the cap → age the report out
of the window → pressure decays back to baseline) is deferred to the human's activation checklist. This
slice flips NO flag.

**Human gates preserved.** `world_balance_enabled` stays `'false'`; ALL Phase 11–18 flags remain
`'false'`; migrations `0001–0134` untouched (forward-only — `0135` is new); no new cron (the existing
60s `process_location_state_ticks()` → `worldstate_tick()` path is reused verbatim); backend-only (no
`src/**`); no `game_config` runtime write; no lit-path/production DB run; no `main` touch; no
merge/deploy/workflow dispatch — activation is the human owner's decision. SAFE FOR HUMAN MERGE REVIEW.

**Verify.** Migration is forward-only: `0135` is a new file; `git status` shows the only changes are the
new `0135`, `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`, and this DEV_LOG entry — no shipped migration edited. The
byte-identical-while-dark property is established by the logic walk above. **The M2–M4.5 / M5 verify
suites could NOT be run locally**: they connect to a live Supabase (service-role key in `.env.local`),
which the human gates forbid (no production/lit-path DB run) and where `0135` is not deployed anyway —
so no green/red claim is made on them; the dark-safety argument rests on the logic walk + forward-only
proof, exactly as the prior dark slices' local verification was doc-level only (`0132–0134` precedent).

## 2026-07-04 — LOCATION-INVEST-P18 SLICE 3 (FINAL) — the dark-posture verifier `verify-location-investment.mjs` + `verify:location-investment`; **Phase 18 CLOSED**

**Request.** Phase 18 final slice: ONE new verify script (the `verify-ranking.mjs` analogue) + one
`package.json` line + same-step doc-sync. NO migration change, NO flag write, NO lit-path DB run, NO
frontend, NO new RPC.

**Work done — `scripts/verify-location-investment.mjs`** (mirrors `verify-ranking.mjs` point-for-point;
ZERO inline harness copies — imports the shared `resolveEnv`/`createReporter`/`createUserFactory`/
`Abort` from `scripts/lib/verify-harness.mjs` + `teardownVerifier` from `scripts/lib/
verifier-teardown.mjs`, same `admin`/`anon`/throwaway-user/`cfgVal` scaffold, same `.catch/.finally`
teardown with NO flag entry passed — this verifier touches no flag). Proves migrations `0132–0134`
ship exactly as built and fully dark, with anon/authenticated clients only. Five assertion groups:
1. **Dark rejection** — `invest_in_location(<uuid>, 1, <uuid>)`, `get_location_development(<uuid>)`,
   `get_location_investment_leaderboard(<uuid>, 10)`, and `get_my_location_investments()` all return
   `{ok:false, code:'feature_disabled'}` while `location_investment_enabled='false'`; VALID-shaped
   args are passed precisely so the identical dark answer proves the anti-probe gate fires BEFORE any
   validation (ship_not_owned / not_docked / unknown_location are NOT reached). CODE-keyed, matching
   the 0133/0134 read/write envelopes.
2. **Owner-read posture (NOT public — the Phase-18 divergence from Ranking's public tables)** — the
   authenticated own-set of `location_investments` reads back empty (0 rows) on a fresh DB (RLS
   `player_id = auth.uid()`), and anon SELECT is DENIED (no anon grant — 0132 grants to authenticated
   ONLY). **Deviation noted:** the instruction's Group-2 wording said "anon returns 0 rows", but the
   shipped 0132 grant excludes anon, so anon is DENIED — the stronger, truthful proof of owner-read
   (NOT public). The verifier asserts anon-DENIED + authenticated-0-rows.
3. **No client write path** — a direct authenticated-client insert into `location_investments` is
   denied (no insert policy / no write grant — 0132).
4. **Internal surface locked** — the private sole-writer `location_investment_invest` AND the internal
   helper `location_investment_current_window` are BOTH denied to the authenticated client and to anon
   (service-role-only — 0133/0134).
5. **Config presence** (READ-ONLY; `String()` storage-form-tolerant compares) —
   `location_investment_enabled='false'`, `location_investment_min_amount='1'`,
   `location_investment_season_seconds='604800'`,
   `location_investment_season_epoch_seconds='1767225600'`.

`package.json` — one line adjacent to `verify:ranking`:
`"verify:location-investment": "node scripts/verify-location-investment.mjs"`.

**Lit-path DEFERRED (the verify-ranking stance verbatim).** The script NEVER writes `game_config` /
NEVER flips `location_investment_enabled`; it exercises NO lit path. Lit-path verification — flag on →
a docked ship → `invest_in_location` debits credits via `wallet_debit` and appends exactly one ledger
row → a replay of the same `request_id` is a no-op (no double debit) → `get_location_development`
reflects the new `all_time_total`/`season_total` → `get_location_investment_leaderboard` ranks the
contributor within the current window → crossing into the next window resets `season_total` while
`all_time_total` + the ledger persist → withdrawal/payout is impossible (one-way sink) — is deferred
to the human owner's activation checklist (flip the flag on a DEV database and run the lit checks
there, never here). Because `0132–0134` are not deployed, local verification is `node --check
scripts/verify-location-investment.mjs` only.

**Doc-sync (same step).** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` INTENTIONALLY UNTOUCHED — a verifier script + a
`package.json` line add no table, writer, function, or cross-system edge (the Phase-15/16/17
slice-verifier precedent). Only this DEV_LOG entry is the doc change.

**Phase 18 (Location Investment) CLOSED — backend + verifier deliverables:**
- `0132` — the dark flag `location_investment_enabled='false'` + the `location_investments` append-only,
  monotonic per-contribution ledger (owner-read, client-unwritable).
- `0133` — the `location_investment_invest` SOLE writer via the public `invest_in_location` wrapper: a
  docked-gated, ledger-row-as-receipt idempotent, strict ONE-WAY credit sink (`wallet_debit` down, no
  withdrawal/no payout) + the `location_investment_min_amount='1'` floor.
- `0134` — the ONE season-window helper `location_investment_current_window()` + the three dark read
  RPCs (`get_location_development`, `get_location_investment_leaderboard` public;
  `get_my_location_investments` own-history): persistent-vs-seasonal as TWO derived reads over the one
  ledger, window derived deterministically from config (no season table, no coupling to Ranking).
- `verify-location-investment.mjs` — the dark-posture verifier + `verify:location-investment`.

**Human gates preserved.** `location_investment_enabled` stays `'false'`; ALL Phase 11–18 flags remain
`'false'`; migrations `0001–0134` untouched (forward-only); backend-only (no `src/features/**`); no
`game_config` write; no lit-path DB run; no cron scheduled; no `main` touch; no merge / deploy /
production apply / workflow dispatch — activation is the human owner's decision. SAFE FOR HUMAN MERGE
REVIEW.

**Verify.** `node --check scripts/verify-location-investment.mjs` → parses OK. `git status --porcelain`
shows the ONLY changes are the new script + `package.json` + this DEV_LOG entry; no migration,
`SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`, flag, or `main` touched.

## 2026-07-04 — LOCATION-INVEST-P18 SLICE 2 — the dark PUBLIC read surface (development vs seasonal score) + the ONE season-window helper

**Request.** The Phase-18 read surface: ONE new forward-only migration exposing the persistent state vs
the seasonal score, plus the caller's own history, plus the ONE shared season-window helper (window
math in exactly one place), with same-step doc-sync. Reuse the Ranking read surface (0131 — `stable
security definer`, dark-gate FIRST, code-keyed envelopes, anon+authenticated PUBLIC leaderboards,
limit-clamp, `row_number()`), the own-history idiom (0106/0110), and `cfg_num`. Still NO writer, NO
frontend, NO cron, NO flag flipped true.

**Self-approved locked design (this slice).**
- **Config-derived WEEKLY window with a fixed epoch.** `location_investment_season_seconds = '604800'`
  (7-day weekly cadence) + `location_investment_season_epoch_seconds = '1767225600'`
  (2026-01-01T00:00:00Z anchor). Both are numeric unix-seconds so the window helper computes purely via
  the existing `cfg_num` — NO new `cfg_text` helper.
- **The single window helper.** `location_investment_current_window()` returns `(window_index,
  window_start, window_end)` via `k = floor((now − epoch)/period)`, `window_start = to_timestamp(epoch
  + k·period)`, `window_end = window_start + period`. It is THE ONE definition of "the current season
  window" — every windowed read calls it, so no season table exists and no window arithmetic is
  duplicated (does NOT re-create Ranking's `ranking_season_open` machinery).
- **Persistent-vs-seasonal = TWO reads over ONE ledger.** Persistent development (all-time SUM +
  distinct-contributor count per location) and seasonal score (windowed SUM) are both DERIVED at read
  time from `location_investments` — never a stored denormalized row (the 0131 law). SECURITY DEFINER
  aggregates across owners but exposes ONLY totals/ranked scores; individual rows stay behind the 0132
  owner-read RLS and surface only via the own-history RPC.
- **Public leaderboards vs owner-read rows.** The location/leaderboard reads are PUBLIC (anon +
  authenticated — the 0131 public-aggregate posture; an aggregate leaks no raw rows). The own-history
  read is authenticated-only and query-scoped `player_id = auth.uid()`.

**Work done — `supabase/migrations/20260618000134_location_invest_p18_read_surface.sql`:**
- **(a)** seeded the two season-window tunables (`on conflict do nothing`; consumed this slice — no
  dead config).
- **(b)** `location_investment_current_window()` — `stable`, `language sql`, INTERNAL (client-revoked).
- **(c1)** `get_location_development(uuid)` — PUBLIC; dark gate → `unknown_location` → window →
  `{ok:true, location_id, all_time_total, contributor_count, season_total, window_index, window_start,
  window_end}`.
- **(c2)** `get_location_investment_leaderboard(uuid, int default 100)` — PUBLIC; dark gate →
  `unknown_location` → clamp [1,500] → window → ranked `rows:[{rank, player_id, season_score}]`.
- **(c3)** `get_my_location_investments()` — authenticated; dark gate → auth → own rows joined to
  `locations` for the name, newest first → `rows:[{investment_id, location_id, location_name, amount,
  invested_at}]`.
- **(d)** ACL (the 0131/0106 posture): the two location/leaderboard reads granted to anon +
  authenticated; own-history to authenticated only; the window helper revoked from all clients
  (internal).

**Doc-sync (same step).** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` §1 matrix UNCHANGED (read-only functions add no
table/writer — stated in the migration header per the 0131/0106 precedent). §2 Location Investment row
gained the three RPCs + the window helper, recorded the now-realized DOWNWARD **Map** read edge (reads
`locations` for validation/identity) alongside the existing Reference/Config edge, and noted
persistent-vs-seasonal as two derived reads over the one append-only ledger, public leaderboards vs
owner-read rows, all dark-gated FIRST, still acyclic (nothing calls into Investment).

**Human gates preserved.** `location_investment_enabled` stays `'false'` (dark — every read gate rejects
today). No flag flipped true; migrations `0001–0133` untouched (forward-only, new file only);
backend-only (no `src/features/**`); no cron scheduled; no `main` touch; no merge/deploy. SAFE FOR HUMAN
MERGE REVIEW.

**Verify.** SQL (no `node --check`): inspected against the 0131 read idiom (stable security definer,
dark-gate-first code envelopes, clamp, `row_number()`, anon+authenticated ACL) and the 0106 own-history
idiom; `cfg_num` returns double precision, so the window arithmetic and `to_timestamp` compose without a
cast beyond the explicit `extract(epoch …)::double precision`. `git status --porcelain` shows the ONLY
changes are the new migration + `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` + `docs/DEV_LOG.md`; no shipped `0001–0133`
migration edited, no flag flipped.

---

## 2026-07-04 — LOCATION-INVEST-P18 SLICE 1 — the sole-writer invest command (`invest_in_location` → `location_investment_invest`) + min-amount tunable

**Request.** The Phase-18 core write path: ONE new forward-only migration adding the SOLE-writer invest
command (the only path that writes `location_investments`) + its one consumed tunable, with same-step
doc-sync. Reuse the established idioms — the Trade Market `market_buy` command (0089) + the shared
docked-location resolver `mainship_resolve_docked_location` (0092) for ownership + dock resolution, the
Wallet sink `wallet_debit`/`wallet_ensure` (0093) for the one-way debit, and the two-layer
wrapper→private + advisory-lock-before-replay + verbatim-replay idempotency of
`craft_module`/`production_craft_module` (0109). Still NO read surface, NO frontend, NO cron, NO flag
flipped true. Also fold in the STEP-1 reviewer nit: move the §1 `location_investments` matrix row to
sit after `ranking_standings` (restore Ranking's contiguous two-row group).

**Self-approved locked design (this slice).**
- **DOCKED-LOCATION-GATED.** An investment targets the ship's CURRENTLY DOCKED location, resolved
  server-side via `mainship_resolve_docked_location` (never a client-supplied location) — not docked →
  `not_docked`. The resolved id is a real `locations(id)` (from the present/location fleet), so the
  ledger FK is satisfied by construction.
- **LEDGER-ROW-AS-RECEIPT idempotency.** No separate receipts table — the `location_investments` row
  IS the receipt. A per-player advisory lock `('location_investment', player)` is taken BEFORE the
  replay check (the 0109/0078 idiom); a replayed `(player, request_id)` returns the original row's
  envelope verbatim (0089/0109 trade-receipt semantics, no payload-conflict check). A raced
  `unique (player_id, request_id)` trip is caught in a sub-block: the savepoint rolls back that call's
  debit (NO double-charge) and replays the now-existing row.
- **ONE-WAY SINK.** `wallet_debit(player, amount)` DOWNWARD (false → `insufficient_credits`, no row
  written); on success exactly ONE append. There is NO `wallet_credit` / NO withdrawal / NO payout
  anywhere in Investment — score/development can never be farmed (ROADMAP :93 guard "no infinite
  exploit").
- **MIN-AMOUNT FLOOR.** `location_investment_min_amount = '1'` (anti-dust/spam), consumed THIS slice
  (no dead config); amount `<= 0` or `< floor` → `invalid_amount`, nothing spent.
- **REQUEST_ID TYPE BRIDGE (deviation, reported).** Per the directive, the command's `p_request_id`
  is `uuid` (same type as `market_buy`'s, 0089:66 — intrinsically bounded, null-only check). The
  shipped ledger column `location_investments.request_id` is `text` (0132, the `module_craft_receipts`
  idiom, which pairs with a text-param command). 0132 is forward-only / not editable, so the command
  bridges at the single ledger boundary with an explicit `p_request_id::text` cast (uuid→text is
  canonical + deterministic, so the idempotency key is preserved). Documented in-line.
- **ENVELOPES** are code-keyed (`{ok:false, code:'…'}`) — the 0131 posture; no localized message layer
  this slice (presentation belongs to the read/UI slice). The private writer returns well-formed code
  envelopes; the wrapper passes them through verbatim.

**Work done — `supabase/migrations/20260618000133_location_invest_p18_invest_command.sql`:**
- **(a)** seed `location_investment_min_amount = '1'` (`on conflict (key) do nothing`). No
  season-window tunables (those belong to the read slice).
- **(b1)** private `location_investment_invest(uuid, uuid, numeric, uuid)` — SECURITY DEFINER, the SOLE
  writer: dark gate FIRST → request_id null-check → per-player advisory lock → verbatim replay →
  `mainship_resolve_docked_location` → amount/min-floor validation → `wallet_debit` → ONE ledger row →
  success envelope; unique-violation sub-block backstop replays without double-debit.
- **(b2)** public `invest_in_location(uuid, numeric, uuid)` — authenticated wrapper: auth → dark gate
  (anti-probe) → `mainship_resolve_owned_ship` (`ship_not_owned`) → delegate → pass through.
- **(c)** ACL per the 0109 targeted idiom: private revoked from public/anon/authenticated + granted to
  service_role; public revoked from public/anon + granted to authenticated. No blanket relock (the
  0064 default-privileges revoke already denies new functions; recent migrations use per-function ACL).

**Doc-sync (same step).** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` §1 — the `location_investments` sole writer is now
the concrete `location_investment_invest` (via `invest_in_location`), and the row was MOVED to sit after
`ranking_standings` (the STEP-1 reviewer nit; Ranking's two rows are contiguous again). §2 Location
Investment — recorded both functions and replaced "no cross-system edge yet" with the now-REALIZED
DOWNWARD edges (Wallet `wallet_debit` · Main Ship `mainship_resolve_owned_ship` +
`mainship_resolve_docked_location` · Reference/Config `cfg_bool` + `cfg_num`); nothing calls into
Investment → acyclic. Added the "mutate `location_investments` outside `location_investment_invest`"
Must-NOT (the sole-writer law).

**Human gates preserved.** `location_investment_enabled` stays `'false'` (dark — both the wrapper gate
and the writer's first check reject every call today). No flag flipped true; migrations `0001–0132`
untouched (forward-only, new file only); backend-only (no `src/features/**`); no cron scheduled; no
`main` touch; no merge/deploy. SAFE FOR HUMAN MERGE REVIEW.

**Verify.** SQL (no `node --check`): inspected against the 0089 (`market_buy` ownership + docked +
`wallet_debit` + code envelopes) and 0109 (two-layer wrapper, advisory-lock-before-replay,
verbatim-replay, per-function ACL) idioms — signatures verified against source
(`mainship_resolve_owned_ship(uuid,uuid)` 0081, `mainship_resolve_docked_location(uuid)` 0092,
`wallet_debit(uuid,numeric)` 0093, `market_buy` request_id `uuid` 0089). `git status --porcelain` shows
the ONLY changes are the new migration + `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` + `docs/DEV_LOG.md`; no shipped
`0001–0132` migration edited, no flag flipped.

## 2026-07-04 — LOCATION-INVEST-P18 SLICE 0 — dark flag + the `location_investments` root table (foundations only)

**Request.** Begin Phase 18 (Location investment — ROADMAP :93, "seasonal investment score vs
persistent state", guard "no infinite exploit"), mirroring the proven RANKING-P17 slice-0 shape
(migration `0127`) exactly. ONE new forward-only migration establishing the dark capability gate + the
Location-Investment-owned persistent root table, with same-step doc-sync. NO writer function, NO invest
command, NO read RPC, NO aggregate read surface, NO frontend, NO cron, NO tunables beyond the flag,
NOTHING client-writable, NO flag flipped true.

**Self-approved locked design (owner-directed, recorded here so later slices are grounded).** Location
Investment is a NEW, DARK, downward **LEAF** owning exactly ONE persistent table — the append-only,
monotonic per-contribution ledger `location_investments`.
1. **Persistent state** (a location's "development") = the all-time SUM of contributions per
   `location_id`, DERIVED from the ledger — never a denormalized column (the 0131 "derived, never
   stored" stance).
2. **Seasonal score** = a player's contributions SUMMED within the CURRENT season WINDOW, the window
   derived DETERMINISTICALLY from config (a period length + epoch tunable) in the consuming slice — NO
   season table, NO season-open writer, so it does **not** duplicate Ranking's `ranking_season_open`
   machinery (the no-duplication hard rule) and adds **no** season coupling to Ranking. Reset-by-season
   (ROADMAP law) is honored STRUCTURALLY: a new window resets the windowed SCORE read while the ledger
   (persistent state) is never touched. Those tunables are NOT seeded this slice (no dead config) —
   they land in the slice that consumes them.
3. **No infinite exploit** (the ROADMAP guard) = investment is a strict ONE-WAY SINK: `amount` CHECK
   (>0); the future invest command debits credits via `wallet_debit` DOWNWARD then appends a row; NO
   withdrawal path, NO payout returning value → score/development can never be farmed in a loop.
4. Edges (all DOWNWARD, acyclic, realized in later slices): Investment → Wallet (`wallet_debit` sink) ·
   Map (read `locations`) · Reference/Config (`cfg_bool`/`cfg_num`). Nothing calls into Investment.

**Work done — `supabase/migrations/20260618000132_location_invest_p18_flag_and_ledger.sql`** (mirrors
`0127` structure + header discipline):
- **(a) dark gate** — `insert into game_config ('location_investment_enabled', 'false', …)
  on conflict (key) do nothing` (the exact 0097/0102/0107/0117/0124/0127 slice-0 flag idiom); the
  description records the server-authoritative reject-before-any-read posture every future Investment
  RPC must adopt and that the UI stays hidden independently (fails closed both sides). No other config
  value seeded this slice.
- **(b) `location_investments`** — the append-only per-contribution ledger. Receipt idiom matched
  POINT-FOR-POINT to `module_craft_receipts` (0109): `player_id uuid not null references auth.users(id)
  on delete cascade`, `request_id text not null`, `unique (player_id, request_id)` (player-scoped,
  non-spatial — NOT the ship-scoped trade keying). Plus `investment_id uuid pk default
  gen_random_uuid()`, `location_id uuid not null references locations(id)` (Map target; `locations.id`
  confirmed PK), `amount numeric not null check (amount > 0)`, `invested_at`/`created_at timestamptz
  default now()`. Two supporting indexes: `(location_id, invested_at)` (sum-by-location = persistent
  development) and `(player_id, invested_at)` (sum-by-player-within-window = seasonal score). RLS
  enabled; ONE owner-read select policy (`player_id = auth.uid()`) + `grant select to authenticated`
  ONLY — NO insert/update/delete policy, NO write grant → clients cannot mutate; sole writer is
  Investment's own future SECURITY DEFINER command. `comment on table` captures append-only/monotonic,
  the persistent-vs-seasonal split, the one-way-sink rationale, and the dark gate. No function created
  → no execute-surface relock needed (0054/0127 precedent). The table is inert — no RPC/reader/writer
  references it yet.

**Doc-sync (same step).** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` §1 matrix gains the `location_investments` row
under the NEW **Location Investment** system (sole writer = future invest command, owner read, DARK,
append-only, persistent-vs-seasonal derivation), and §2 gains the **Location Investment** system row (a
NEW DARK downward LEAF: owns `location_investments`; edges all DOWNWARD/acyclic — Wallet · Map ·
Reference/Config; Must-NOT includes withdraw/pay out, write another system's table, store a
denormalized aggregate, delete/truncate to reset, duplicate Ranking's season machinery, or invest while
the gate is off; explicitly notes this slice adds NO cross-system edge yet).

**Human gates preserved.** `location_investment_enabled` stays `'false'` (dark). No flag flipped true;
migrations `0001–0131` untouched (forward-only, new file only); backend-only (no `src/features/**`); no
cron scheduled; no `main` touch; no merge/deploy. SAFE FOR HUMAN MERGE REVIEW.

**Verify.** SQL (no `node --check`): inspected against the `0127` idiom — flag insert, table shape, RLS
posture, grants, and `comment on table` all match the slice-0 precedent; receipt columns match
`module_craft_receipts` (0109) exactly. `git status --porcelain` shows the ONLY changes are the new
migration + `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` + `docs/DEV_LOG.md`; no shipped `0001–0131` migration edited, no
flag flipped.

## 2026-07-04 — RANKING-P17 CLEANUP — correct two stale figures in the `verify-harness.mjs` header (docs-in-code only)

**Request.** Final Phase-17 Ranking auto-cleanup pass. The STEP 1 read-only audit
(`RANKING_CLEANUP_RECON.local.md`) found the milestone clean on every claim EXCEPT one narrow
docs-in-code defect: the shared harness's in-file ADOPTION / RETIREMENT PLAN header carried two stale
figures. This slice corrects ONLY those figures — no logic change, no migration, no flag change, no
frontend; `ranking_enabled` stays `'false'`.

**Defect (audit Claim 4).** `scripts/lib/verify-harness.mjs` header said (a) "the **31** sibling
`verify-*.mjs` scripts still carry inline copies" and (b) cited the `osn_distance`
adopt-on-next-real-change precedent as `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md:75–78`. Both were wrong: there are only
**27** `scripts/verify-*.mjs` files, of which **7** already import the harness (captain, captain-progression,
exploration, fitting, mining, modules, ranking) → **20** remaining (not 31); and lines `75–78` are the
Fleet/Movement/Presence/Activity matrix rows — the actual "OSN geometry leaf" note is at
`docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md:101–104` (the "should adopt the helper whenever they are next re-defined"
sentence is `:103–104`).

**Work done — `scripts/lib/verify-harness.mjs` (header comment ONLY):** rewrote the ADOPTION /
RETIREMENT PLAN paragraph to state the self-checking accounting — 27 total / 7 adopters (named) / 20
remaining — and corrected the precedent citation to `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md:101–104`. Added an explicit
retirement condition (plan discharged when all 27 import the harness). NO exported function, no
`loadEnv`/`resolveEnv`/`createReporter`/`createUserFactory` logic, and no other line changed — the harness
code and its behavior are untouched. Re-verified the 27/7/20 split by counting `scripts/verify-*.mjs` and
`grep -l "lib/verify-harness"` this step.

**Verify.** `node --check scripts/lib/verify-harness.mjs` → parses OK. `node --check
scripts/verify-ranking.mjs` → parses OK (unchanged, sanity re-check). No migration, `package.json`,
`verify-ranking.mjs`, flag, or `main` touched; `ranking_enabled` remains `'false'` (dark). SAFE FOR HUMAN
MERGE REVIEW.

## 2026-07-04 — RANKING-P17 SLICE 5 — the dark-posture verifier `scripts/verify-ranking.mjs` + `verify:ranking` (FINAL Phase-17 slice)

**Request.** Phase 17 Slice 5 (final): ONE new verify script (the `verify-captain-progression.mjs`
analogue) + one `package.json` line + same-step doc-sync. NO migration change, NO flag write, NO
lit-path testing, NO frontend, NO new read RPC.

**Work done — `scripts/verify-ranking.mjs`** (mirrors `verify-captain-progression.mjs` point-for-point;
ZERO inline harness copies — imports the shared `resolveEnv`/`createReporter`/`createUserFactory`/
`Abort` from `scripts/lib/verify-harness.mjs` + `teardownVerifier` from `scripts/lib/
verifier-teardown.mjs`, same `admin`/`anon`/throwaway-user/`cfgVal` scaffold, same `.catch/.finally`
teardown with NO flag entry passed — this verifier touches no flag). Proves migrations `0127–0131`
ship exactly as claimed and fully dark, with anon/authenticated clients only. Five assertion groups:
1. **Dark rejection** — `get_ranking_seasons()` and `get_ranking_leaderboard(<valid uuid>,'combat',10)`
   both return `{ok:false, code:'feature_disabled'}` while `ranking_enabled='false'`; a valid uuid +
   real dimension are passed precisely so the identical dark answer proves the anti-probe gate fires
   BEFORE any validation (unknown_season / invalid_dimension are NOT reached). CODE-keyed, matching the
   0131 read surface.
2. **Public-read posture** — anon can SELECT `ranking_seasons` and `ranking_standings` (permitted, 0
   rows on a fresh DB — reading the public tables back IS the assertion, the catalog-table precedent).
3. **No client write path** — direct authenticated-client inserts into `ranking_seasons` AND
   `ranking_standings` are denied (no insert policy / no write grant — 0127/0128).
4. **Internal surface locked** — `ranking_season_open`, `ranking_accrue_standings`, and
   `ranking_score_delta` are denied to the authenticated client, and `ranking_accrue_standings` is
   denied to anon (service-role-only — 0129/0130).
5. **Config presence** — `ranking_enabled` reads `'false'` (READ-ONLY; storage-form-tolerant
   `String(v)==='false'` compare).

**No-flag-write / no-lit-path stance** (verbatim to `verify-captain-progression.mjs`): the script NEVER
writes `game_config` and NEVER flips `ranking_enabled`. Lit-path verification — flag on →
`ranking_season_open` opens an active season → deposit finalized `reward_grants` →
`ranking_accrue_standings` folds them once → a re-run is a no-op → `get_ranking_leaderboard` ranks them
(overall = sum of per-dimension scores) → opening a new season closes the prior active one while
PRESERVING the closed season's standings rows — is DEFERRED to the human owner's activation checklist
(flip the flag on a DEV database and run the lit checks there, never here). Because `0127–0131` are not
deployed, local verification is `node --check scripts/verify-ranking.mjs` only (**parses OK**); the
script is NOT executed against a live DB this slice (its execution belongs to the owner's post-apply
checklist, exactly as the prior dark verifiers).

**`package.json`.** Added one line adjacent to `verify:captain-progression`:
`"verify:ranking": "node scripts/verify-ranking.mjs"`.

**Doc-sync (same step).**
- `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` — **intentionally UNTOUCHED**. A verifier script + a `package.json` line
  add NO table, writer, function, or cross-system edge (the Phase-15/16 slice-verifier precedent — the
  law doc describes architectural facts, and nothing architectural changed). Stated here explicitly
  rather than editing it.
- `docs/DEV_LOG.md`: this entry.

**Phase 17 status — CLOSED (backend + verifier deliverables).** The Ranking milestone is complete and
PR-ready on the feature branch, fully dark and server-rejected:
- `0127` — `ranking_enabled='false'` dark flag + `ranking_seasons` root table.
- `0128` — `ranking_standings` per-(season, player, dimension) schema (dimension = the `reward_grants.
  source_type` domain 1:1; overall derived at read time).
- `0129` — `ranking_season_open` (sole writer of `ranking_seasons`; natural-key idempotent;
  close-prior-active = reset by season, not deletion).
- `0130` — `ranking_score_delta` + `ranking_accrue_standings` (sole writer of `ranking_standings`;
  incremental high-water fold reading `reward_grants` DOWNWARD — the acyclic Ranking→Reward edge).
- `0131` — `get_ranking_seasons` + `get_ranking_leaderboard` (public, dark-gated read surface).
- `verify-ranking.mjs` — the dark-posture verifier.

**Human gates preserved.** `ranking_enabled` stays `'false'` (no flag flipped); every Phase 11–17 flag
remains `'false'`. NO migration changed (`0127–0131` and all of `0001–0126` untouched). NO
`game_config` write. NO lit-path DB run (deferred to the owner's activation checklist). Backend-only
(no `src/features/**`). No merge/deploy/production apply/workflow dispatch. Activation (flipping
`ranking_enabled` true + scheduling the accrual cron) is the human owner's decision, not this loop's.

## 2026-07-04 — RANKING-P17 SLICE 4 — the dark read surface `get_ranking_seasons` + `get_ranking_leaderboard` (migration `0131`)

**Request.** Phase 17 Slice 4: ONE new forward-only migration (the two public leaderboard/season read
RPCs) + same-step doc-sync. Still NO frontend, NO flag flipped, NO cron, NO new table/writer.

**Work done — migration `20260618000131_ranking_p17_read_surface.sql` (forward-only; `0001–0130`
unedited).** Two READ-ONLY RPCs mirroring the 0123/0116 read-surface idiom (jsonb envelope · `stable`
· `security definer` · dark-gate FIRST · SELECT only Ranking's own public tables · no write anywhere):
- **`get_ranking_seasons() → jsonb`** — dark-gate FIRST (`cfg_bool('ranking_enabled')` false →
  `{ok:false, code:'feature_disabled'}`). When enabled: `{ok:true, seasons:[…]}` selecting
  `season_id, cadence, label, starts_at, ends_at, status` from `ranking_seasons`, ordered `cadence,
  starts_at desc` (active naturally sorts to the top within a cadence).
- **`get_ranking_leaderboard(p_season_id uuid, p_dimension text, p_limit int default 100) → jsonb`** —
  dark-gate FIRST (same disabled envelope). When enabled: validate `p_dimension in
  ('combat','trade','exploration','mining','overall')` else `invalid_dimension`; validate the season
  exists else `unknown_season`; clamp `p_limit` to `[1, 500]` (default 100). For a concrete dimension:
  the `ranking_standings` rows for `(season_id, dimension)`, ranked `score desc, player_id` with a
  1-based `row_number()` rank, limited. For `'overall'`: **derived at read time** — `sum(score)`,
  `sum(events_counted)` grouped by `player_id` across the season, same ranking/limit — NEVER a stored
  row (the slice-1 Must-NOT). Returns `{ok:true, season_id, dimension, rows:[{rank, player_id, score,
  events_counted}, …]}`.
- **ACL** (the 0123 idiom, adjusted for PUBLIC leaderboards): `revoke execute … from public, anon;
  grant execute … to anon, authenticated`. Granted to **anon + authenticated** (not authenticated-only
  like the captain own-roster surface) because leaderboards/season info are PUBLIC — the 0127/0128
  `ranking_seasons`/`ranking_standings` public-read posture. No auth.uid() check / no per-player
  scoping — the exposed data is already public.

**Deliberate divergences from the captain read surface (grounded).**
- **Public, not own-data:** grant anon + authenticated; no auth check.
- **Envelope key `code`** (not `reason`) — consistent with the Ranking writers (0129/0130).
- **`'overall'` derived at read time** — sums per-dimension scores on the fly, no stored denormalized
  row (upholds the slice-1 standings Must-NOT).

**Boundary placement (same-step doc-sync).**
- **§1 matrix UNCHANGED** — read-only functions add NO new table and NO new writer, so the sole-writer
  matrix is untouched (the 0101/0106/0110/0116/0123 precedent: read surfaces are recorded in the §2
  system row, not the matrix). Stated here explicitly rather than editing §1.
- `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` §2 **Ranking** row: recorded `get_ranking_seasons` +
  `get_ranking_leaderboard` (READ-ONLY, dark-gated, PUBLIC anon+authenticated, overall derived at read
  time, no writer added); confirmed NO new cross-system edge (they read only Ranking's own tables +
  `cfg_bool`) — call graph still ACYCLIC, nothing calls into Ranking.
- `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` §2 "Ranking read-edge is acyclic" note: extended the `cfg_bool` edge
  list to include the two read RPCs; noted they SELECT only Ranking's own public tables and write
  nothing (overall derived, never stored).
- `docs/DEV_LOG.md`: this entry.

**Human gates preserved.** `ranking_enabled` stays `'false'` (no flag flipped; both RPCs' dark gate
rejects every call today with the identical anti-probe envelope); every Phase 11–17 flag remains
`'false'`. No existing migration edited (`0001–0130` untouched, forward-only). No `game_config` value
changed. Backend-only (no `src/features/**`). No cron. No merge/deploy/production apply/workflow
dispatch. Surface is inert while dark: the RPCs exist and are grant-scoped, but server-reject every
call until the human activates.

## 2026-07-04 — RANKING-P17 SLICE 3 — the core standings-scoring accrual `ranking_accrue_standings` (the SOLE writer of `ranking_standings`, reading `reward_grants` DOWNWARD; migration `0130`)

**Request.** Phase 17 Slice 3: ONE new forward-only migration (the standings accrual writer) +
same-step doc-sync. Still NO read RPC, NO frontend, NO flag flipped, NO cron scheduled.

**Metric lock (read first, no guessing).** Re-confirmed the EXACT `reward_grants.rewards` bundle shape
from 0040/0015: `{ "metal": <number>, "items": [ { "item_id": "...", "quantity": <int> }, … ] }` — the
item quantity key is **`quantity`** (0040:64 `(el->>'quantity')::numeric`). The per-event score value
is defined in ONE place, `ranking_score_delta(p_rewards jsonb) returns numeric` (IMMUTABLE,
single-source, testable): `coalesce(metal,0) + coalesce(sum of item quantities,0)`. Rationale:
standings are PER-DIMENSION separate leaderboards (slice 1), so absolute scale is irrelevant within a
board; a reward-magnitude metric is uniform across dimensions, deterministic, and computed purely from
the finalized event. The items sum is guarded to a real jsonb array (the 0040 "fail safely" ethos — a
malformed row can never abort the batch; metal-only combat bundles simply have no `items` key → 0).

**Work done — migration `20260618000130_ranking_p17_accrue_standings.sql` (forward-only; `0001–0129`
unedited).**
- **`ranking_score_delta(jsonb) → numeric`** — IMMUTABLE, service-role-only (client-revoked). The ONE
  place the per-event score is defined.
- **`ranking_accrue_standings() → jsonb`** — PRIVATE, `SECURITY DEFINER`, service-role-only, THE sole
  writer of `ranking_standings`. Batch accrual over ALL active seasons (cron/admin-style, no player
  input):
  1. **DARK GATE FIRST** — `if not cfg_bool('ranking_enabled')` → `{ok:false, code:'feature_disabled'}`
     before any read/write (folds nothing while dark).
  2. **Advisory lock** `pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext('ranking_accrue_standings'), 0)` — concurrent
     accruals serialize.
  3. **Incremental, idempotent fold** — one statement (`with folded … , upserted as (insert … on
     conflict … do update) …`). Source: `reward_grants rg` joined to each `ranking_seasons s where
     s.status='active'` on `rg.granted_at between s.starts_at and s.ends_at`, LEFT JOIN the existing
     `ranking_standings st` on `(season_id, player_id, source_type)`. **High-water filter:** fold only
     `(st.last_counted_at is null and rg.granted_at >= s.starts_at) or (rg.granted_at >
     st.last_counted_at)` — NULL high-water counts from season start inclusive; strict `>` afterward
     makes re-runs a no-op. `group by (season_id, player_id, source_type)` → `score =
     sum(ranking_score_delta(rewards))`, `events_counted = count(*)`, `last_counted_at =
     max(granted_at)`. `on conflict … do update set score = score + excluded.score, events_counted =
     events_counted + excluded.events_counted, last_counted_at = greatest(…), updated_at = now()`.
     `dimension = rg.source_type` directly (the slice-1 1:1 domain lock — no translation); the fold is
     scoped `rg.source_type in ('combat','trade','exploration','mining')` so an out-of-domain source
     (none exist today) is skipped rather than aborting the batch / tripping the dimension CHECK.
  4. Returns `{ok:true, seasons_scored, rows_upserted, events_folded}` (a summary for the future
     cron/verifier).
  - **ACL**: `revoke execute … from public, anon, authenticated; grant … to service_role` (0129
    private-writer block). **No public wrapper, no cron scheduled** — accrual is a server/cron/admin
    op; scheduling is deferred, and the dark-gated fn is a safe no-op until the human activates it.

**Reset-by-season semantics.** The fold's window is bounded by each ACTIVE season's `[starts_at,
ends_at]`; a CLOSED season (closed by `ranking_season_open`, 0129) is no longer joined so it stops
accruing, but its standings rows remain intact. A "reset" is a new active season scoping a fresh
standings set — NEVER a delete of any standings or `reward_grants` event data.

**Boundary placement (same-step doc-sync).**
- `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` §1: updated the `ranking_standings` row — sole writer is now the CONCRETE
  `ranking_accrue_standings` (0130) (was "future scoring fn"); service-role-only + DARK +
  incremental-by-`last_counted_at`; the `ranking_score_delta` metric; no-cron-yet.
- `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` §2 **Ranking** row: recorded `ranking_accrue_standings` + the
  `ranking_score_delta` helper as the standings writer, and added the concrete **Ranking → Reward
  (`reward_grants` read)** DOWNWARD edge — the FIRST realized cross-system read.
- `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` §2 notes: added a **"Ranking read-edge is acyclic"** note (the "Trade
  fan-out is acyclic" precedent — the home for dark-phase cross-system edge facts, since §3 is the
  fixed MVP-5-entry-points snapshot the activity securing processors also don't touch): confirms
  Ranking → Reward + Ranking → Reference/Config are the only edges, both DOWNWARD reads; Reward never
  reads Ranking; nothing calls into Ranking → **ACYCLIC**, one sole-writer per Ranking table.
- `docs/DEV_LOG.md`: this entry.

**Human gates preserved.** `ranking_enabled` stays `'false'` (no flag flipped; the writer's dark gate
folds nothing today); every Phase 11–17 flag remains `'false'`. No existing migration edited
(`0001–0129` untouched, forward-only). No `game_config` value changed. Backend-only (no
`src/features/**`). No player wrapper / no client execute grant. No cron scheduled. No
merge/deploy/production apply/workflow dispatch. Surface is inert: dark-gated + service-role-only, no
caller/schedule exists.

## 2026-07-04 — RANKING-P17 SLICE 2 — the season-management writer `ranking_season_open` (the SOLE writer of `ranking_seasons`; migration `0129`)

**Request.** Phase 17 Slice 2: ONE new forward-only migration (the season-lifecycle writer) +
same-step doc-sync. Still NO standings scoring, NO read RPC, NO frontend, NO flag flipped.

**Work done — migration `20260618000129_ranking_p17_season_open.sql` (forward-only; `0001–0128`
unedited).**
- **Idempotency natural key.** New index `ranking_seasons_cadence_start_uidx` = `unique (cadence,
  starts_at)` on `ranking_seasons` (a NEW index in a NEW migration — `0127` is never edited). A season
  window is uniquely identified by its (cadence, starts_at), so season-open is idempotent WITHOUT a
  receipts table (the 0126 receipt ledger was per-(player, request_id); a lifecycle op is keyed by its
  window, not a client request).
- **`ranking_season_open(p_cadence text, p_starts_at timestamptz, p_ends_at timestamptz, p_label
  text)` → jsonb** — PRIVATE, `SECURITY DEFINER`, service-role-only, THE sole writer of
  `ranking_seasons`. Body mirrors the 0126 `production_recruit_captain` writer idioms:
  1. **DARK GATE FIRST** — `if not cfg_bool('ranking_enabled')` → `{ok:false, code:'feature_disabled'}`
     before any read/write (anti-probe; identical answer while dark; `cfg_bool` (0046) coalesces a
     missing key to false).
  2. **Validation** (no reads): `p_cadence in ('weekly','monthly')` else `invalid_cadence`;
     `p_ends_at > p_starts_at` (both non-null) else `invalid_window`; non-empty trimmed label with a
     sanity length cap (the 0126:121 text-bound hygiene) else `invalid_label`. Codes returned directly
     — no reason→code translation layer (there is no client wrapper).
  3. **Advisory lock** `pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext('ranking_season_open'), hashtext(p_cadence))` —
     concurrent opens of the SAME cadence serialize, so the replay check and the close→insert window
     cannot be raced by another open of this cadence.
  4. **Idempotent replay** from the natural key: if a season exists for (cadence, starts_at), return it
     VERBATIM (`{ok:true, idempotent:true, season_id, cadence, label, starts_at, ends_at, status,
     created_at}`) — NO second insert, NO status churn (a re-open of an already-closed window does NOT
     reactivate it).
  5. **Open new active window** — in the same tx `update … set status='closed' where cadence=… and
     status='active'` (closing the prior active season — reset by season, NOT deletion: its standings
     rows remain under the closed `season_id`), then `insert … status='active'`. The close-prior step
     makes room for the partial unique active index (0127); a raced `unique_violation` on either index
     is caught into a clean `{ok:false, code:'conflict'}` rather than a raw exception.
  - **ACL**: `revoke execute … from public, anon, authenticated; grant … to service_role` (the
    0126:273–274 private-writer block). **No public wrapper** — season management is a
    server/cron/admin operation, not a player command, so it stays service-role-only and dark.

**Design rationale (locked; grounds later slices).**
- **Sole writer, concrete.** This is the function the 0127 §1/§2 "future season fn" note promised — no
  second write path to `ranking_seasons`, ever.
- **Reset by season, never by deletion** (ROADMAP :92). Opening a new active window CLOSES the prior
  active one; nothing is deleted, and standings accrued under the closed `season_id` remain intact
  (a closed season is queryable history; a "reset" is the NEW active season scoping a fresh standings
  set). No DELETE of any season or event data anywhere.
- **One active per cadence** — the close-prior step + the partial unique active index (0127) + the
  per-cadence advisory lock together guarantee exactly one active window per cadence.

**Boundary placement (same-step doc-sync).**
- `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` §1: updated the `ranking_seasons` row — sole writer is now the CONCRETE
  `ranking_season_open` (0129) (was "future season fn"); service-role-only + DARK; recorded the
  natural-key idempotency, the close-prior-active semantics, and the `conflict` guard.
- `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` §2 **Ranking** row: recorded `ranking_season_open` as the
  season-lifecycle writer; added the ONE cross-system edge (Ranking → Reference/Config `cfg_bool`
  read — a DOWNWARD leaf read, acyclic, nothing calls into Ranking); the standings-scoring writer
  stays a later slice; Must-NOT now also forbids deleting closed-season standings.
- `docs/DEV_LOG.md`: this entry.

**Human gates preserved.** `ranking_enabled` stays `'false'` (no flag flipped; the writer's dark gate
rejects every call today); every Phase 11–17 flag remains `'false'`. No existing migration edited
(`0001–0128` untouched, forward-only). No `game_config` value changed. Backend-only (no
`src/features/**`). No player wrapper / no client execute grant. No merge/deploy/production
apply/workflow dispatch. Surface is inert: dark-gated + service-role-only, no caller exists.

---

## 2026-07-04 — RANKING-P17 SLICE 1 — the standings (leaderboard) schema `ranking_standings` (migration `0128`)

**Request.** Phase 17 Slice 1: ONE new forward-only migration (the per-player leaderboard score
schema) + same-step doc-sync. Still NO scoring function, NO season-management writer, NO read RPC, NO
frontend, NO flag flipped.

**Domain lock (read first, no translation layer).** Re-confirmed the EXACT literal set the standings
`dimension` maps to: the `reward_grants.source_type` domain is the closed activity-source set
`('combat','exploration','mining','trade')` established by the 0096
`fleet_movements_reward_source_type_domain` CHECK (the carrier feeding `reward_grant(source_type,…)`).
`reward_grants.source_type` itself is `text not null` (0015, no CHECK), constrained upstream by that
carrier + the direct depositor calls. Live depositors today: combat/exploration/mining call
`reward_grant` directly; **`trade` is in the domain but has NO depositor yet** — Trade V1 banks via the
Wallet path, not `reward_grants` — so its standings stay 0 until a trade activity deposits a grant.
`dimension` uses these four literals verbatim (1:1, no lookup/mapping).

**Work done — migration `20260618000128_ranking_p17_standings_schema.sql` (forward-only; `0001–0127`
unedited).**
- **`ranking_standings`** — the per-(season, player, dimension) score row:
  - `season_id uuid not null references ranking_seasons(season_id) on delete cascade`;
    `player_id uuid not null references auth.users(id) on delete cascade`;
    `dimension text not null check (dimension in ('combat','trade','exploration','mining'))`;
    `score numeric not null default 0`; `events_counted integer not null default 0`;
    `last_counted_at timestamptz` (nullable); `updated_at timestamptz not null default now()`.
  - **PK `(season_id, player_id, dimension)`.**
  - **Leaderboard index `ranking_standings_leaderboard_idx (season_id, dimension, score desc)`** — the
    future read RPC's access path (a season's dimension board, best first).
  - RLS ON + ONE public-read select policy + `grant select to anon, authenticated`; **NO
    insert/update/delete policy and NO write grant** — clients cannot mutate.
  - Table + `last_counted_at` comments record the sole-writer, derived-overall, and high-water-mark
    facts below.

**Self-approved locked design decisions (owner-directed; grounds later slices).**
1. **Dimension = the read source, 1:1, no translation.** `dimension` is exactly the
   `reward_grants.source_type` domain (the 0096 closed set). The scoring fn folds a grant into the row
   of its own `source_type` — no lookup. A future activity source is an additive forward-only CHECK
   change here + at 0096, in lockstep.
2. **One score row per (season, player, dimension); OVERALL is DERIVED at read time** (sum across
   dimensions), NEVER a stored denormalized row — so there is no second write path to keep in sync.
3. **Incremental, idempotent accrual via `last_counted_at`** — the high-water mark of the latest
   `reward_grants.granted_at` already folded in (NULL until first count). The future scoring fn accrues
   only grants with `granted_at > last_counted_at` and advances the mark in the same write, so a re-run
   never double-counts and never re-reads old events (the 0100/0105 `secured_at` idempotency analogue).
4. **No writer this slice.** The SOLE writer of `ranking_standings` is Ranking's OWN future
   season-scoring function (a later slice: `SECURITY DEFINER`, client-revoked). No RPC reads/writes it
   yet — dark, inert.
5. **Reset by season, never by deletion.** A reset is a NEW `season_id` scoping a fresh standings set;
   old standings rows and the `reward_grants` behind them are never deleted. The `on delete cascade` on
   `season_id` is a schema-integrity guard for an intentionally-removed season, NOT the reset mechanism.

**Boundary placement (same-step doc-sync).**
- `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` §1 matrix: added the `ranking_standings` row under the **Ranking** owner
  (sole writer = future scoring fn; public read-only; DARK), adjacent to `ranking_seasons`.
- `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` §2 **Ranking** row: extended Owns to `ranking_seasons, ranking_standings`
  (0128); kept the READ-ONLY-downward-leaf role accurate (reads `reward_grants` DOWNWARD, overall
  derived at read time, edges Ranking → Reward read · Reference/Config flag read — acyclic, nothing
  calls into Ranking). Added the explicit Must-NOT "store a denormalized OVERALL score".

**Human gates preserved.** `ranking_enabled` stays `'false'` (no flag flipped); every Phase 11–17 flag
remains `'false'`. No existing migration edited (`0001–0127` untouched, forward-only). No `game_config`
value changed. Backend-only (no `src/features/**`). No merge/deploy/production apply/workflow dispatch.
Slice is inert: no reader/writer references `ranking_standings` yet.

## 2026-07-04 — RANKING-P17 SLICE 0 — dark flag `ranking_enabled` + the Ranking-owned root table `ranking_seasons` (migration `0127`)

**Request.** Begin Phase 17 (Ranking / competition — ROADMAP :92 "weekly/monthly seasons;
combat/trade/explore/mine · reads finalized events; reset by season, not deletion"). Slice 0 only:
ONE new forward-only migration (the dark flag + the seasons foundation) + same-step doc-sync. NO
scoring/season/read function, NO standings table, NO frontend, NO flag flipped true.

**Work done — migration `20260618000127_ranking_p17_seasons_and_flag.sql` (forward-only; `0001–0126`
unedited).**
- **(a) Dark flag.** Seeded `game_config('ranking_enabled', 'false')` with the exact 0097/0102/0107/
  0117/0124 slice-0 flag idiom (`on conflict (key) do nothing`, inherits the table-wide
  `game_config_public_read` posture). Description records that it gates ALL future Ranking
  scoring/read/season RPCs, each of which must check it FIRST and reject-before-any-read while false
  (fails closed both server + UI). No flag flipped true.
- **(b) `ranking_seasons` — the NEW Ranking-owned root table.** Columns: `season_id uuid pk default
  gen_random_uuid()`, `cadence text check in ('weekly','monthly')`, `label text`, `starts_at`/
  `ends_at timestamptz`, `status text default 'upcoming' check in ('upcoming','active','closed')`,
  `created_at`, plus a table-level `check (ends_at > starts_at)`. Integrity: a **partial unique index
  `ranking_seasons_one_active_per_cadence` (`unique (cadence) where status = 'active'`)** — AT MOST
  ONE active season per cadence. RLS ON + ONE public-read select policy + `grant select to anon,
  authenticated`; **NO insert/update/delete policy and NO write grant** — clients cannot mutate. A
  table comment records: Ranking is the sole writer, seasons are the reset-by-season scoping
  mechanism (never delete event data), DARK behind `ranking_enabled`.

**Self-approved locked design decisions (owner-directed; grounds later slices).**
1. A **season is a named scoring WINDOW per cadence**. A weekly AND a monthly season may run
   CONCURRENTLY over the same finalized events (independent leaderboards) — cadence is part of
   identity, not mutually exclusive. Direct reading of "weekly/monthly seasons".
2. **Reset-by-season, NEVER by deletion** (ROADMAP law). A reset is a NEW season row scoping a new
   `[starts_at, ends_at)` window; the finalized event ledger (`reward_grants`) is never deleted or
   truncated. Scores partition by the window without touching any event.
3. **At most one `active` season per cadence** (the partial unique index) — the "one active window"
   invariant; `upcoming`/`closed` seasons are unconstrained (history + scheduling).
4. **No writer this slice.** The SOLE writer of `ranking_seasons` is Ranking's OWN future
   season-management function (a later slice: `SECURITY DEFINER`, client-revoked; rows are
   runtime-created, NOT migration-seeded). No RPC reads or writes the table yet — dark, inert.

**Finalized-event source (later slices, not built here).** Ranking's read source is the idempotent
reward ledger `reward_grants` (0015): UNIQUE (source_type, source_id) = one row per SECURED activity
result; `source_type` ('combat','exploration','mining','trade' — the closed 0096 activity domain) is
the activity dimension, `player_id` the leaderboard subject, `granted_at` the season-window field. A
per-player, per-season, per-activity score is fully derivable from a plain DOWNWARD read — no writer
to `reward_grants` or any activity table, ever.

**Boundary placement (same-step doc-sync — the 0098/0103/0117 table-creating-slice precedent).**
- `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` §1 matrix: added the `ranking_seasons` row under a NEW **Ranking**
  system (sole writer = Ranking's future season fn; public read-only; DARK behind `ranking_enabled`).
- `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` §2: added the **Ranking** system row — Owns `ranking_seasons` (0127);
  role = a READ-ONLY downward leaf consumer of finalized events (reads `reward_grants` DOWNWARD in
  later slices; writes only its own tables); Must-NOT = write any other system's table, be written by
  any non-Ranking function, or reset scores by deleting event data. Edges (later slices) are all
  DOWNWARD (Ranking → Reward read · Reference/Config flag read) — nothing calls into Ranking, so the
  call graph stays **acyclic**, one sole-writer per table, and Ranking is a NEW dark **leaf** owner.

**Human gates preserved.** `ranking_enabled` stays `'false'` (no flag flipped); every Phase 11–17
flag remains `'false'`. No existing migration edited (`0001–0126` untouched, forward-only). No
`game_config` value changed except ADDING the new dark key. Backend-only (no `src/features/**`). No
merge/deploy/production apply/workflow dispatch. Slice is inert: no reader/writer references
`ranking_seasons` or the flag yet.

## 2026-07-04 — CAPTAIN cleanup audit — SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES §1-matrix doc-sync (rows `captain_types` / `captain_recipe_ingredients` / `ship_captain_assignments`)

**Request.** Cleanup/audit pass over the Captain milestone (Phase 15 assignment 0117–0123 + Phase 16
progression 0124–0126, backend-only). Read-only recon (`CLEANUP_CAPTAIN_RECON.local.md`) + the
narrowest same-step law-doc sync for the ONE defect it found. NO migration change, NO flag write, NO
code/frontend change.

**Defect found (F-1, LOW, docs-only).** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` §1 (the sole-writer matrix) had
three rows frozen at their creation-slice, contradicting the as-built 0120–0126, the fully-current §2
Captain row, and the §4 adapter note (a law doc that contradicts the code is a defect — the doc-sync
law): `captain_types` said "nothing reads them yet", `captain_recipe_ingredients` said "nothing reads
it yet", and `ship_captain_assignments` said "NO caller exists yet" / the settled-SAFE rule "lands in
the later command slice". The parallel rows `ship_module_fittings` (kept current — "called today ONLY
by `fitting_execute_command`"), `captain_instances`, and `captain_assignment_receipts` proved the
matrix was half-updated, not a deliberate convention.

**Fix (docs-only, same step — the `TRADE_ECONOMY_CLEANUP_RECON` doc-only-defect precedent).** Rewrote
the three §1 rows to present tense matching the as-built surface, mirroring the current-row phrasing:
- `captain_types` → "read today by the Phase-15 stats-adapter `calculate_expedition_stats` (0122 …),
  the read surface (0123), and the `captains_mint_instance`/`production_recruit_captain` type-existence
  checks (0118/0126)".
- `captain_recipe_ingredients` → "Read DOWNWARD today by its consumer, the Phase-16 Production-owned
  recruit command `production_recruit_captain` (0126), for the recruit cost".
- `ship_captain_assignments` → the settled-SAFE rule "lives in the command `captain_execute_command`
  (0121 …)"; "the command `captain_execute_command` translates" its exception-style reasons; "called
  today ONLY by that command (0120/0121)"; "the adapter (0122)" (was "the future adapter").

The SOLE-WRITER / ownership facts in all three rows were already correct and are unchanged; only the
stale reader/caller/rule-timing prose was corrected. §2, §4, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and every
migration are untouched (they were already in sync). No flag flipped; `0001–0126` unedited; no
`game_config` value touched.

## 2026-07-04 — CAPTAIN-P16 SLICE 4 — the dark-posture verifier `scripts/verify-captain-progression.mjs` (the verify-captain.mjs analogue) + the self-approved "no new read RPC" decision

**Request.** Phase 16 slice 4, the final implementation slice: ONE new verify script proving
migrations 0124–0126 ship exactly as claimed and fully dark, mirroring `verify-captain.mjs`
point-for-point for the recruitment surface, plus one `verify:captain-progression` package.json line
and same-step doc-sync. NO migration change, NO flag write, NO lit-path testing, NO frontend, NO new
read RPC.

**Work done — NEW `scripts/verify-captain-progression.mjs`** (mirrors `verify-captain.mjs`; ZERO
inline harness copies — imports `resolveEnv`/`createReporter`/`createUserFactory`/`Abort` from
`scripts/lib/verify-harness.mjs` + `teardownVerifier` from `scripts/lib/verifier-teardown.mjs`; the
same `admin`/`anon`/throwaway-user/`cfgVal` scaffold and the same `.catch/.finally` teardown, passing
NO flag entry since this verifier touches none). Assertions, all with anon/authenticated clients only:

- **§1 Dark rejection** — with a throwaway authenticated user, a syntactically valid `p_request_id`
  AND a REAL captain type id (`'gunnery_veteran'`), `recruit_captain` returns `{ok:false,
  code:'feature_disabled'}` — the anti-probe gate fires BEFORE any validation while
  `captain_progression_enabled='false'`. CODE-keyed (like `craft_module` 0109), NOT the reason-keyed
  assignment surface — the 0126 wrapper envelope matched exactly.
- **§2 Recipe catalog contract** — reads `captain_recipe_ingredients` publicly and asserts the exact
  0125 seed set verbatim: the five recipes' `(captain_type_id, item_id, qty)` rows (gunnery_veteran
  shard1/weapon_parts3/pirate_alloy2 · trade_broker shard1/scrap8/repair_parts2 · survey_cartographer
  shard1/scan_data4/anomaly_shard2 · extraction_foreman shard1/ore6/crystal2 · fleet_quartermaster
  shard1/repair_parts3/engine_parts2), and every `qty > 0`. Reading the public seeds back IS the
  public-read posture assertion.
- **§3 Player-state RLS + no client write path** — `captain_recruit_receipts` returns 0 rows for a
  fresh user, and a direct client insert is denied (no insert policy / no write grant — 0126).
- **§4 Internal surface locked** — `production_recruit_captain` denied to the authenticated client;
  `recruit_captain` denied to anon.
- **§5 Config presence** — `captain_progression_enabled` reads `'false'` (READ-ONLY; the
  storage-form-tolerant `String(v)==='false'` compare).

**No-flag-write / no-lit-path stance** (verbatim to `verify-fitting.mjs`/`verify-captain.mjs`): the
script NEVER writes `game_config` and NEVER flips `captain_progression_enabled`. Lit-path
verification (flag on → recruit within balance → success + one new `captain_instances` row + one
receipt → insufficient balance → `insufficient_items` → verbatim replay returns the original receipt
without a second mint/spend → unknown_captain / no_recipe reasons) is DEFERRED to the human owner's
activation checklist — flip the flag on a DEV database and run the lit checks there, never here.

**`package.json`** — one new line adjacent to `verify:captain`:
`"verify:captain-progression": "node scripts/verify-captain-progression.mjs"`.

**Self-approved read-surface decision (2026-07-04): NO new read RPC for Phase 16.** Following the
0110 precedent (decision 2 — a read RPC that duplicates an already-available surface is not added),
Phase 16 adds NO get-recipe/get-receipt RPC because every recruitment-relevant surface is ALREADY
readable: (a) the recruitment RESULT — captain instances — is exposed by `get_my_captain_instances()`
(0123); (b) the recipe catalog `captain_recipe_ingredients` is public-read (clients select it
directly, the `item_types`/`captain_types` stance); (c) `captain_recruit_receipts` is owner-read
(direct select). A get-catalog/receipt RPC would duplicate an already-available surface — so none is
added. (When the feature lights up, the client reads its recipes from the public catalog, submits
`recruit_captain`, and sees the new captain via the existing 0123 read.)

**Doc-sync — SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES intentionally UNTOUCHED this slice.** A verifier script + a
package.json line + a not-added read RPC add NO table, NO writer, NO function, NO cross-system edge —
so no architectural fact changed (the slice-I precedent: the Phase-15 verifier left
SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES untouched for the same reason). `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` is deliberately not
edited.

**Human gates preserved.** No flag flipped true, no migration change, no lit-path DB run (the
verifier's execution belongs to the owner's activation checklist, exactly as the Phase-15 slice-I
verifier), no frontend/client change, no production DB / merge / deploy / workflow dispatch. This
CLOSES Phase 16's backend + verifier deliverables — dark, server-rejected, PR-ready on the feature
branch.

---

## 2026-07-04 — CAPTAIN-P16 SLICE 3 — the dark recruit command: `captain_recruit_receipts` + private `production_recruit_captain` + two-layer `recruit_captain` (the 0109 `craft_module` analogue, point-for-point)

**Request.** Phase 16 slice 3, the core: ONE new forward-only migration adding the
Production-owned recruit command, mirroring `0109 module_craft_command` POINT-FOR-POINT with the
captain domain substituted (craft a module → recruit a captain). NO read surface, NO adapter
change, NO frontend, NO flag flipped.

**Work done — NEW `supabase/migrations/20260618000126_captain_p16_recruit_command.sql`** (leaves
`0001`–`0125` unedited; forward-only). Every idiom inherited from the 0109 mirror:

- **`captain_recruit_receipts`** — Production-owned per-player idempotency ledger, the
  `module_craft_receipts` (0109:55–84) shape verbatim: `receipt_id uuid pk default
  gen_random_uuid()`, `player_id → auth.users on delete cascade`, `request_id text`,
  `captain_type_id → captain_types(id)`, `instance_id → captain_instances(id) on delete cascade`,
  `created_at`, `unique (player_id, request_id)`. No extra index (the unique index leads on
  player_id). RLS on, owner-read `captain_recruit_receipts_select_own` `using (player_id =
  auth.uid())`, `grant select to authenticated` (NOT anon), no write path. Table comment matches
  the 0109 shape (sole writer = `production_recruit_captain`; replay verbatim; DARK behind
  `captain_progression_enabled`).
- **`production_recruit_captain(player, captain_type, request_id)`** — PRIVATE writer, SOLE writer
  of `captain_recruit_receipts`, the `production_craft_module` (0109:86–195) body verbatim:
  (1) DARK GATE FIRST `cfg_bool('captain_progression_enabled')` → `feature_disabled` before any
  read; (2) request_id non-empty + `length ≤ 200` → `invalid_request_id`; (3)
  `pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext('captain_recruit'), hashtext(player))` before the replay check;
  (4) idempotency replay — existing `(player, request_id)` receipt rebuilds the original success
  envelope verbatim (`idempotent_replay:true`, no re-spend/re-mint, no payload-conflict check);
  (5) catalog validation — type exists → else `unknown_captain`; recipe rows exist → else
  `no_recipe` (distinct truthful reasons); (6) ingredient PRE-CHECK loop over
  `captain_recipe_ingredients` (ordered by item_id) via `inventory_get_balance` → `insufficient_items`
  + `{item_id, have, need}` BEFORE any spend; (7) SPEND loop via `inventory_spend` (any exception
  rolls back the whole tx — no receipt, nothing minted); (8) MINT exactly ONE via
  `captains_mint_instance(player, captain_type, 'recruit:'||player||':'||request_id)` — namespaced
  per 0108, can never collide with `craft:`; (9) insert the receipt + return `{ok:true, receipt_id,
  instance_id, captain_type_id, recruited_at}`.
- **`recruit_captain(request_id, captain_type)`** — authenticated public wrapper, the `craft_module`
  (0109:197–263) idiom: `auth.uid()` null → `not_authenticated`; flag gate FIRST (anti-probe,
  identical answer while dark) → `feature_disabled`; delegate; on success re-emit; on failure map
  `reason` → `code`/`message` (`invalid_request_id`→`invalid_request`; `unknown_captain`;
  `no_recipe`→"This captain cannot be recruited yet."; `insufficient_items`→"Not enough materials to
  recruit this captain." + pass-through `{item_id, have, need}`; else `unavailable`).
- **ACLs** (0109:265–273): private writer revoked from public/anon/authenticated, granted
  service_role; wrapper revoked from public/anon, granted authenticated.

**DARK — the whole surface ships server-rejected.** `captain_progression_enabled='false'` (0124),
so the wrapper's gate AND the writer's first check both reject every call; no receipt/instance row
can exist today. No client UI (backend only, like Phase 15).

**Boundary edges (all DOWNWARD, acyclic — no cycle).** `production_recruit_captain` fans out
one-directionally: Production → Inventory (`inventory_spend`, reusing 0109's EXISTING spend edge) ·
Production → Captain (`captains_mint_instance` mint — this is now that leaf's FIRST caller) ·
Production → Captain recipe read (`captain_recipe_ingredients`) · Production → Reference/Config
(`cfg_bool`). Recruitment NEVER touches `player_inventory`/`inventory_ledger`/`captain_instances`
directly — only through the two leaves (the forbidden-column law). Captain stays a pure
instance-leaf: the recipe CONFIG is Captain's, the recruit COMMAND is Production's (which owns the
Inventory spend), so there is NO Captain→Inventory edge and NO second writer to any table.

**Doc-sync (SAME step).**
- `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` §1 matrix gains `captain_recruit_receipts` under **Production**
  (sole writer = `production_recruit_captain`; owner-read; DARK behind `captain_progression_enabled`),
  adjacent to `module_craft_receipts`.
- §2 **Production** row: Owns column gains `captain_recruit_receipts *(0126)*`; the row body adds the
  `recruit_captain`→`production_recruit_captain` two-layer command with its new DOWNWARD edges
  (Production → Captain mint + recipe read, reusing Production → Inventory spend + Reference/Config);
  the Must-NOT column adds "write captain_instances directly (recruit minting ONLY via
  `Captain.captains_mint_instance`)" and "recruit while the gate is off".
- §2 **Captain** row + §1 `captain_instances` row: the "NO caller exists yet" note on
  `captains_mint_instance` is REPLACED — its ONE caller is now `production_recruit_captain` (0126);
  the DARK gate reference updated to `captain_progression_enabled` (the recruit command's gate). The
  0125 recruit-recipe-config note updated from "next-slice consumer" to "consumer is now 0126". This
  is the 0109-replaces-Modules-note precedent (a law doc must never contradict the code).

**Human gates preserved.** No flag flipped true (`captain_progression_enabled` and all captain flags
stay `'false'`), no read surface, no adapter change, no frontend/client change, no migration
`0001`–`0125` edited, no production DB / merge / deploy / workflow dispatch. Dark, server-rejected,
PR-ready on the feature branch.

## 2026-07-04 — CAPTAIN-P16 SLICE 2 — the recruitment recipe catalog `captain_recipe_ingredients` + seeds (the 0107 `module_recipe_ingredients` analogue)

**Request.** Phase 16 slice 2: ONE new forward-only migration adding the recruit recipe config
table `captain_recipe_ingredients` (the captain analogue of Modules' `module_recipe_ingredients`,
0107) + five seed recipes, plus same-step doc-sync. NO command, NO writer, NO RPC, NO adapter
change, NO frontend, NO flag flipped.

**Recipe design decision (self-approved 2026-07-04).** The recruit recipe is a normalized,
items-only, existing-items-only catalog — the exact 0107 recipe posture, one implicit recipe per
captain type:

- **Normalized-table encoding, not jsonb** (0107 decision 3): FK to `captain_types` + `item_types`,
  `qty > 0` CHECK, composite PK `(captain_type_id, item_id)` — real referential integrity, no
  parallel jsonb recipe vocabulary.
- **Items-only cost** — the pipeline law: progression consumes INVENTORY, so recruitment's cost
  lands ONLY in `player_inventory` (via the next-slice command's `inventory_spend`), NEVER in
  metal/credits/Base/Wallet.
- **`captain_memory_shard` the shared gating ingredient** — the 'progression'/'rare' item (0039)
  seeded expressly for this, `qty 1` on every recipe; each type adds two specialization-flavored
  materials from the existing catalog.
- **Existing `item_types` only** (0039 + 0097) — no new item invented; quantities in the 0107 1–8
  band.

**Work done — NEW `supabase/migrations/20260618000125_captain_p16_recruit_recipes.sql`** (leaves
`0001`–`0124` unedited; forward-only):

- `create table public.captain_recipe_ingredients (captain_type_id text ref captain_types(id),
  item_id text ref item_types(item_id), qty integer check (qty>0), created_at, PK
  (captain_type_id, item_id))` — mirrors `module_recipe_ingredients` line-for-line.
- RLS/grants VERBATIM from 0107:96–98 — RLS enabled, ONE public-read select policy
  `captain_recipe_ingredients_public_read` `using (true)`, `grant select to anon, authenticated`,
  NO insert/update/delete policy, NO write grant → clients cannot mutate; only migration/service_role
  write (the 0039/0107 catalog posture).
- Five seeds (`on conflict (captain_type_id, item_id) do nothing`), all item ids verified to exist
  and all captain_type ids verified against 0117:
  - `gunnery_veteran` (combat): `captain_memory_shard` 1 · `weapon_parts` 3 · `pirate_alloy` 2
  - `trade_broker` (trade): `captain_memory_shard` 1 · `scrap` 8 · `repair_parts` 2
  - `survey_cartographer` (exploration): `captain_memory_shard` 1 · `scan_data` 4 · `anomaly_shard` 2
  - `extraction_foreman` (mining): `captain_memory_shard` 1 · `ore` 6 · `crystal` 2
  - `fleet_quartermaster` (support): `captain_memory_shard` 1 · `repair_parts` 3 · `engine_parts` 2

**INERT this slice.** Nothing reads the table yet. Its FIRST consumer is the next-slice
**Production**-owned recruit command (ROADMAP law 5 "Production = crafting"), which reads this config
DOWNWARD — the acyclic 0109 fan-out: Production → Captain recipe read · Production → Inventory
`inventory_spend` · Production → Captain `captains_mint_instance` mint. One sole-writer per table;
this slice adds NO writer and NO cross-system edge, and NO Captain→Inventory edge (Captain stays a
pure instance-leaf; the recipe CONFIG belongs to Captain, the recruit COMMAND to Production).

**Doc-sync (SAME step — the 0107 catalog-table-creating precedent).**
- `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` §1 matrix gains `captain_recipe_ingredients` under **Captain**
  (catalog/config — seeded by migration only, NO runtime writer; public read-only), adjacent to
  `captain_types`, mirroring how `module_recipe_ingredients` sits under Modules.
- §2 Captain row: the Owns column gains `captain_types, captain_recipe_ingredients *(catalog/config
  … no runtime writer)*` (the Modules-row idiom), and the row body notes the recruit recipe config
  now exists with its first consumer the next-slice Production recruit command — NO writer/edge
  added this slice.
- A pure catalog table under an existing system adds a table but NO new writer/function and NO
  cross-system edge, so the acyclic ownership graph is unchanged; documenting the new owned config
  IS the required sync (unlike 0124's pure flag seed, which added no table and so left
  SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES untouched).

**Human gates preserved.** No flag flipped true (all captain flags stay `'false'`), no
frontend/client change, no migration `0001`–`0124` edited, no production DB / merge / deploy /
workflow dispatch. Backend catalog/config only, on the feature branch.

---

## 2026-07-04 — CAPTAIN-P16 SLICE 1 — the dark capability flag `captain_progression_enabled = 'false'` (flag-only, the 0107/0117 seed idiom) + the self-approved Phase-16 design decision

**Request.** Phase 16 slice 1: ONE new forward-only migration seeding exactly one `game_config`
row `captain_progression_enabled = 'false'`, mirroring the 0117 `captain_assignment_enabled` /
0107 `module_crafting_enabled` flag-seed idiom, plus same-step doc-sync. NO recipe table, NO
command, NO writer, NO adapter change, NO frontend, NO flag flipped true.

**Self-approved Phase-16 design decision (owner-directed 2026-07-04; recorded here so later slices
are grounded).** Phase 16 "Captain progression (consumes inventory)" (ROADMAP :91) is the captain
analogue of module crafting (Phase 13 / 0109 `craft_module`):

- **Mechanism = captain RECRUITMENT via consuming inventory.** A dark, idempotent command spends a
  per-captain-type item recipe through the Inventory `inventory_spend` leaf (0039) and mints ONE
  `captain_instances` row through the already-built `captains_mint_instance` leaf (0118 — built
  explicitly for "Phase-16 progression consuming inventory"). This is the truest reading of ROADMAP
  law 3 (Progression = the inventory-consuming acquisition system): "inventory is the bridge".
- **Reuse, no new writer.** Recruitment NEVER touches `player_inventory` / `inventory_ledger` /
  `captain_instances` directly — ONLY through the two pre-built leaves. No second writer to
  `captain_instances` (sole writer stays `captains_mint_instance`), no schema change to it, no
  adapter change (the 0122 stats feed reads the minted rows unchanged). Edges all DOWNWARD
  (Progression command → Inventory `inventory_spend` · Captain `captains_mint_instance` ·
  Reference/Config catalog + this flag), acyclic — the exact 0109 fan-out shape. Any recruitment
  bookkeeping that would otherwise need a second writer to an existing table lives in a NEW
  progression-owned table with its OWN sole writer, read DOWNWARD by the adapter.
- **Later slices, all gated on THIS flag** (reject-before-any-read while false): a Production-owned
  recruitment receipts table + its private writer + a two-layer public wrapper command (the
  0109/0113 idiom, PLAYER-scoped request_id idempotency), plus a per-captain-type recipe catalog.

**Work done — NEW `supabase/migrations/20260618000124_captain_p16_progression_flag.sql`** (leaves
`0001`–`0123` unedited; forward-only):

- Seeds exactly one `game_config` row: `('captain_progression_enabled', 'false', …)` with a
  description mirroring the 0117 wording — server-authoritative dark gate for Phase-16 captain
  progression (recruitment that consumes `player_inventory`); OFF until the owner explicitly
  enables it; every Phase-16 RPC must check it FIRST and reject-before-any-read while false; UI
  stays hidden independently (fails closed both sides).
- `on conflict (key) do nothing` — idempotent. Flips NO flag true, creates NO table/function.
- The migration header records the full self-approved Phase-16 locked design above.

**FLAG-ONLY AND INERT.** No RPC, recipe table, writer, or reader references the flag yet — the
0117 "flag exists dark, no RPC yet" posture. The row inherits the table-wide public-read
`game_config_public_read` policy (0003:13-15). No execute-surface relock needed (no function
created — 0054 precedent).

**Doc-sync — SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES intentionally UNTOUCHED this slice.** Re-read
`docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`: `game_config` is already Reference/Config public-read (§1 matrix,
"`unit_types`, `game_config`, …"), and a pure key seed adds NO table, NO writer, NO cross-system
edge — so no architectural fact changed. Per the 0117-analogue deferral (a doc must never describe
state that isn't real — the 0111:57-58 no-row-yet posture), NO §2 Captain-progression system row is
added until a writer/function actually exists in a later slice. SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES is deliberately
not edited.

**Human gates preserved.** No flag flipped true (`captain_progression_enabled` and all captain
flags stay `'false'`), no frontend/client change, no migration `0001`–`0123` edited, no production
DB / merge / deploy / workflow dispatch. Backend flag-seed only, on the feature branch.

---

## 2026-07-04 — CAPTAIN-P15 SLICE I — the DARK-posture verifier `scripts/verify-captain.mjs` (the verify-fitting.mjs analogue; the sole remaining Phase-15 deliverable)

**Request.** Phase 15 slice I: ONE new verify script proving migrations 0117–0123 ship exactly as
claimed and fully dark, mirroring `verify-fitting.mjs` point-for-point for the captain surface, plus
one `verify:captain` package.json line and same-step doc-sync. NO migration change, NO flag write,
NO lit-path testing, NO frontend.

**Work done — NEW `scripts/verify-captain.mjs`** (mirrors `verify-fitting.mjs`; ZERO inline harness
copies — imports `resolveEnv`/`createReporter`/`createUserFactory`/`Abort` from
`scripts/lib/verify-harness.mjs` and `teardownVerifier` from `scripts/lib/verifier-teardown.mjs`):
- **§1 Dark rejection** — with a throwaway authenticated user and syntactically VALID uuids/
  request_ids (so the identical answer proves the anti-probe gate fires BEFORE any validation):
  `assign_captain_to_ship` / `unassign_captain_from_ship` / `get_my_captain_instances` /
  `get_my_ship_captains` all return `{ok:false, reason:'captain_assignment_disabled'}` (the 0120
  wrapper + 0123 read envelopes — reason-keyed, the ONE server-driven visibility signal, adapted
  from fitting's code-keyed `feature_disabled`).
- **§2 Catalog contract** — reads `captain_types` `id/name/specialization/description/stats_json`
  back verbatim for all five 0117 seeds (gunnery_veteran combat/attack 4 · trade_broker
  trade/cargo 8 · survey_cartographer exploration/scan 3 · extraction_foreman mining/mining 4 ·
  fleet_quartermaster support/repair 3) and asserts every `specialization` sits in the CHECK set —
  reading the public seeds back IS the public-read posture assertion (the item_types/module_types
  posture).
- **§3 Player-state RLS + no client write path** — `captain_instances` / `ship_captain_assignments`
  / `captain_assignment_receipts` each return 0 rows for a fresh user, and direct client inserts are
  denied (no insert policy / no write grant — 0118/0119/0120).
- **§4 Internal surfaces locked** — `captain_assign_apply` / `captain_execute_command` /
  `captain_command_client_envelope` / `mainship_space_assert_settled_safe` denied to the
  authenticated client; the four public RPCs denied to anon.
- **§5 Config presence** — `captain_assignment_enabled` reads `'false'` (READ-ONLY).
- **Deliberate no-flag-write / no-lit-path stance** (copied from `verify-fitting.mjs:20–28`): the
  script NEVER writes `game_config` and NEVER flips `captain_assignment_enabled`; every assertion
  runs with anon/authenticated clients only; `service_role` is used ONLY for teardown (delete the
  throwaway user via the shared `teardownVerifier`, no flag entry passed). Lit-path verification
  (assign within slots → success + adapter stats change with specialization tradeoffs → over-capacity
  `captain_slots_full` → settled-SAFE `ship_not_settled` → already/not-assigned → verbatim replay
  without double-assign → unassign reverts stats) is deferred to the human owner's activation
  checklist — flip the flag on a DEV database and run the lit checks there, never here.

**`package.json`** — one line added adjacent to `verify:fitting`:
`"verify:captain": "node scripts/verify-captain.mjs"`.

**Doc-sync.** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` **untouched** — a verifier adds NO table, NO writer, NO
cross-system edge, so no architectural fact changed (the ownership matrix and Captain §2 row are
already correct as of slices A–G).

**Verify:** `npm run build` green (confirms nothing else drifted). The verifier itself is dark-posture
proof only — it is NOT run against production and requires no flag flip.

---

## 2026-07-04 — CAPTAIN-P15 SLICE G — the dark read surface: `get_my_captain_instances()` + `get_my_ship_captains(ship)` (the 0110/0116 analogues)

**Request.** Phase 15 slice G: ONE new forward-only migration with exactly two read-only RPCs,
each mirroring its own analogue's idiom precisely (0110 for the instances roster, 0116 for the
per-ship roster — both read first per the slice spec), plus same-step doc-sync. NO frontend, NO
verify scripts, NO adapter change, NO flag changes.

**Work done — NEW `supabase/migrations/20260618000123_captain_p15_read_surface.sql`**
(0001–0122 unedited):
- **`get_my_captain_instances()`** — the 0110 shape with its check ordering copied exactly
  (auth → dark gate → query): jsonb envelope · `stable` · `security definer set search_path =
  public` · dark gate on `captain_assignment_enabled` BEFORE any row read, returning the
  identical literal `{ok:false, reason:'captain_assignment_disabled'}` for every caller (no
  probing while dark; the same envelope the 0120 wrappers emit — ONE visibility signal) ·
  own-rows-only query (query-scoped `player_id = auth.uid()`, defense in depth over RLS) joining
  `captain_instances` to `captain_types` display identity (name / specialization / stats_json) ·
  `jsonb_agg(… order by created_at desc)` newest-first · `{ok:true, captains:[…]}` — PLUS a
  per-row assignment indicator (the assigned `main_ship_id` or null) via LEFT JOIN to
  `ship_captain_assignments`, so the client renders roster state from one call. **LOCKED
  DECISION (header):** the left join is read-only display data — no new writer, no new
  dependency direction (a Captain-owned function reading Captain-owned tables + the public
  catalog).
- **`get_my_ship_captains(p_main_ship_id uuid)`** — the 0116 shape including its exact
  gate/auth ORDERING (0116:23–26/51–56: gate FIRST, then auth — copied verbatim as the slice
  spec requires): identical dark reject → auth → ship validated by the **(main_ship_id,
  player_id) pair** (the 0079 multi-ship posture; foreign = missing → `ship_not_owned`) → that
  ship's roster joined via `captain_instances` to `captain_types`, ordered `assigned_at desc,
  captain_instance_id` (the 0116 determinism idiom with the uuid tiebreak) → `{ok:true,
  captains:[…]}`. **NO COUNTS — 0116 returns none, so none were added** (the slice spec's
  mirror rule; no speculative surface). The 0116:18–22 deliberate-omission rationale transfers:
  limits come from the client's own `main_ship_instances` rows (the 0043 grant covers
  `captain_slots`) or `get_my_expedition_preview` (carries `captain_slots_used/limit` since
  0122).
- **NO catalog RPC** — the 0110:9–15 stance: `captain_types` is a public-read Reference/Config
  catalog the client selects directly; a get-catalog RPC would duplicate an already-public
  surface.
- **ACLs** copied from the analogues (0110:72–75 / 0116:84–87): both RPCs `revoke from public,
  anon; grant execute to authenticated`. Dark today — the gates reject every call.
- **`docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`** (same step): the §2 Captain row gains the read-surface
  contract (two gated read RPCs, identical dark envelope, own-rows only, the assignment
  indicator's no-new-writer note, the no-counts and no-catalog-RPC stances). §1 matrix unchanged
  — read surfaces are recorded in the §2 system row, not the matrix (the 0101/0106/0110/0116
  precedent).
- **Verify:** `npm run build` green (SQL-only slice — confirms nothing else drifted). §5
  invariant checklist re-read: NO new table, NO new writer (both functions are pure reads —
  every sole writer unchanged); no new cross-system edge (Captain-owned functions reading
  Captain-owned tables + the public catalog — graph unchanged, acyclic); no client write path
  (read-only RPCs, authenticated-only); reward path and combat truth untouched; no flag flipped
  — the whole surface ships server-rejected.

## 2026-07-04 — CAPTAIN-P15 SLICE F — assigned captains feed `calculate_expedition_stats` (the 0115 analogue; third feed block, headcount-capped)

**Request.** Phase 15 slice F, the 0115 analogue recon §5 fully determines: ONE new forward-only
migration re-creating `calculate_expedition_stats` with EXACTLY one addition — a THIRD feed
block for captains — the support-craft and module paths byte-identical. NO read surfaces, NO
frontend, NO verify scripts, NO flag changes.

**Work done — NEW `supabase/migrations/20260618000122_captain_p15_stats_adapter.sql`**
(0001–0121 unedited; a `create or replace` re-create, the 0044/0115 forward-only idiom):
- **The captain block, mirroring 0115:157–196 point for point:** new declares (`c` /
  `v_cap_used` / `v_cap_speed_bonus`); roster read `ship_captain_assignments` →
  `captain_instances` → `captain_types` filtered by `a.main_ship_id = v_ship.main_ship_id` with
  NO player filter (the 0115:47–50 rationale cited in the header: the (1)(2) ship read proves
  ownership; `captain_assign_apply`'s owner-consistency invariant (0119) covers the rest);
  contributions into the SAME nine accumulators from the exact stats_json key list
  (attack/defense/repair/cargo/scan/mining/evasion, coalesced to 0) with `speed_mult_bonus`
  summed into `v_cap_speed_bonus` — ONE stat pipeline, no parallel vocabulary.
- **Tradeoffs (locked values, header-documented):** a `specialization` CASE, one slot each so no
  cost scaling — combat → attention +2, spd_pen +0.02 · trade → attention +1, spd_pen +0.02 ·
  exploration → attention +1 · mining → attention +1, spd_pen +0.02 · support → 0 (a captain
  draws attention like crewed hardware; support-role captains are the low-profile option;
  magnitudes mirror 0115's per-slot numbers).
- **Headcount HARD cap:** `v_cap_used > v_ship.captain_slots → raise` — count-based (one captain
  = one slot), defense-in-depth over the 0119 assign-time gate; refuse, never clamp.
- **Speed:** `round(greatest(0.2, v_speed * (1 + v_mod_speed_bonus + v_cap_speed_bonus) * (1 -
  a_spd_pen)), 3)` — the captain bonus joins the module bonus ADDITIVELY inside the one
  multiplier; a zero-captain ship reduces EXACTLY to the 0115 expression.
- **Output:** exactly two added keys `captain_slots_used` / `captain_slots_limit`, mirroring the
  module pair; no existing key's value changes for a zero-captain ship.
- **Compatibility contract (header, the 0115:10–18 way):** verify:phase8 /
  verify:mainship-preview / verify:fitting assert field VALUES and list-membership, never an
  exact key SET → additive keys are safe; and no assignment row can exist until the owner flips
  `captain_assignment_enabled` (0117 flag dark; 0118 instances have no producer; 0119–0121
  command chain service_role-only/dark) → live behavior is unchanged today.
- **Diff proof run against 0115's shipped body:** the ONLY changes are (a) the three captain
  declares, (b) the captain feed block + count hard cap inserted between the module cap and the
  speed expression, (c) the one speed-expression edit (+ its comment), (d) the two output keys.
  The support-craft and module paths are byte-identical.
- **ACL:** the 0115:232–233 targeted re-assert verbatim — revoke from public/anon/authenticated,
  grant service_role only.
- **`docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`** (same step): §4 item 8 now records the third read edge
  (Captain), the three hard caps (`support_capacity` / `module_slots` / `captain_slots` —
  captain cap count-based), the additive speed-bonus composition, the two new output keys, and
  the "(later +captains)" note reworded as REDEEMED — THE single source of expedition stats
  (still not wired into live combat; the proven fleet-stack path owns outcomes). The §2 Captain
  row's inbound note gains the adapter-read edge (the 0115 Fitting precedent) — still nothing
  writes through Captain but its own command.
- **Verify:** `npm run build` green (SQL-only slice — confirms nothing else drifted). §5
  invariant checklist re-read: the adapter owns no table and mutates nothing (pure read/compute,
  `stable`); no writer changes anywhere; the new edge is DOWNWARD read-only (adapter → Captain —
  graph stays acyclic); no client write path (service_role-only); reward path and combat truth
  untouched; no flag flipped.

---

## 2026-07-04 — CAPTAIN-P15 SLICE E — the settled-SAFE rule for captain assignment + the `mainship_space_assert_settled_safe` shared-leaf extraction (fitting re-created behavior-identically)

**Request.** Phase 15 slice E, the 0114 analogue: read 0114 first, determine whether the
settled-SAFE check is a callable helper or inline, then add the same rule to captains honoring
the no-duplication HARD RULE. NO adapter change, NO read surfaces, NO frontend, NO verify
scripts, NO flag changes.

**What 0114 was read to contain:** the check is INLINE in `fitting_execute_command`
(0114:126–142) — no callable composite exists; 0114:41–44 explicitly recorded "no shared-helper
extraction is needed" because the mechanism appeared ONCE. Captain is now the second consumer →
the hard rule triggers the extraction in this same step (case (b) of the slice spec).

**Work done — NEW `supabase/migrations/20260618000121_captain_p15_settled_safe_rule.sql`**
(0001–0120 unedited; 0114/0120 stay as history):
- **NEW shared leaf `mainship_space_assert_settled_safe(p_main_ship_id uuid) returns boolean`** —
  the 0114:126–142 composite VERBATIM: `mainship_space_validate_context` ok AND validated state
  in `('home','at_location')` (the 0100/0105 SAFE set) AND
  `mainship_space_assert_cross_domain_exclusion` ok; fail-closed (legacy NULL / in_space /
  in_transit / destroyed / incoherent → false). Main-Ship-owned (`mainship_space_*` family),
  service_role-only (the 0056 family ACL posture). **Signature is ship-id-ONLY, deliberately
  without the p_player_id the slice spec's example sketched:** its family siblings
  (0056:91/224) take only the ship id, and ownership resolution is per-action per-system
  semantics that must stay in each command for the fitting re-create to be behavior-identical —
  a player param would be either dead or a behavior change.
- **`fitting_execute_command` re-created — a PURE refactor, ZERO behavior change** (the
  compatibility contract stated in the header the 0115:10–18 way). **Diff proof run against
  0114's shipped body:** the ONLY changes are (a) two declare lines dropped (`v_val`/`v_excl`
  moved into the leaf), (b) the step-6 comment updated to name the leaf, (c) the inline
  two-step check block replaced by the single leaf call inside the same
  `if v_check_ship is not null` guard (short-circuit AND preserves skip-if-null). Same reads,
  same evaluation order, same single truthful `ship_not_settled`. Wrappers, writer, receipts,
  mapper untouched on the fitting side.
- **`captain_execute_command` re-created with the rule** — the 0120 header's promised
  forward-only amendment (the P14 0113→0114 split, delivered). LOCKED DECISIONS (header):
  placement AFTER the replay check and action-shape validation, BEFORE delegating to
  `captain_assign_apply` (game rule in the COMMAND, structure in the WRITER); applies to BOTH
  actions — assign checks the TARGET ship (owner-scoped, `ship_not_owned` at this layer — the
  0114 fit-branch shape), unassign checks the ship the captain is CURRENTLY assigned to
  (owner-scoped read of `ship_captain_assignments`; an unassigned captain SKIPS the rule — the
  structural writer's truthful `not_assigned` handles it, the exact 0114 unfit-branch
  semantics) — because a loadout, captain roster included, is frozen
  mid-transit/in-space/mid-combat; reject reason = the same truthful `ship_not_settled`.
  Everything else byte-identical to 0120.
- **`captain_command_client_envelope` re-created ONLY to add the `ship_not_settled` mapping**
  (reason + player-facing copy — 0120 shipped without it because the rule did not exist yet;
  the 0114:164–165 re-create rationale).
- **ACLs:** the new leaf service_role-only; the three re-created functions' grants re-asserted
  (the 0114:217–224 idiom). No other grants touched.
- **Safe to ship dark:** `captain_assignment_enabled` and `module_fitting_enabled` are both
  `'false'` — no caller could reach the rule-less 0120 command in the gap, and none can reach
  these; no flag touched.
- **`docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`** (same step): the §2 Captain row's deferral note replaced by
  the shipped settled-SAFE contract (rule position in the flow, both-action semantics, the
  skip-for-unassigned nuance) and its edges sentence now names the shared leaf; the §2 Fitting
  row's inline-check wording now records that the composite lives in the shared leaf since 0121
  (pure refactor); a new **Settled-SAFE leaf** note block added beside the OSN-geometry-leaf
  note (the family's documentation home) — including why exploration/mining deliberately do NOT
  consume it (their accepted state is `in_space`, a different rule) — so no section contradicts
  the new leaf.
- **Verify:** `npm run build` green (SQL-only slice — confirms nothing else drifted). §5
  invariant checklist re-read: no new table and no writer change (`ship_captain_assignments` /
  `ship_module_fittings` / both receipt ledgers keep their single writers); the leaf owns no
  table and adds no new cross-system edge (Fitting and Captain already read Main Ship
  downward — graph stays acyclic); no client write path (leaf + commands service_role-only);
  reward path and combat truth untouched; no flag flipped.

## 2026-07-04 — CAPTAIN-P15 SLICE D — the dark assign/unassign command + `captain_assignment_receipts` (settled-SAFE rule deliberately deferred, the 0113→0114 split)

**Request.** Phase 15 slice D, mirroring the P14 command slice (0113): ONE new forward-only
migration adding the player-scoped receipts ledger, the ONE private command, the TWO thin
authenticated wrappers, and the shared reason→envelope mapper, plus same-step doc-sync. NO
adapter change, NO read surfaces, NO frontend, NO verify scripts in this slice.

**Work done:**
- **NEW `supabase/migrations/20260618000120_captain_p15_assign_command.sql`** (0001–0119
  unedited):
  - `captain_assignment_receipts` — the 0113:69–91 posture verbatim: **PK (player_id,
    request_id)** (captains are non-spatial → the PLAYER-scoped keying, not the ship-scoped
    space receipts), action CHECK ('assign','unassign'), request fingerprint columns for audit,
    `result_json` (the success envelope, verbatim replay truth), `created_at`; RLS own-row
    select + `grant select to authenticated`, NO write policy/grant.
  - `captain_execute_command(p_player_id, p_action, p_captain_instance_id, p_main_ship_id,
    p_request_id)` — service_role-only, THE sole writer of the receipts, the exact 0113 flow
    order: **dark gate FIRST** on `captain_assignment_enabled` (reject before any
    read/lock/write) → request_id validation → **per-player advisory lock BEFORE the replay
    check** (the SAME `('captain_assignment', player)` key as `captain_assign_apply` —
    reentrant, so the nested acquisition is safe) → **verbatim replay** of the stored
    `result_json` on (player, request_id) hit (trade semantics, no payload-conflict check) →
    action-shape validation in ('assign','unassign') → **delegate DOWNWARD to the slice-C sole
    writer `captain_assign_apply`** (assign passes the ship id, unassign passes null —
    `ship_captain_assignments` keeps ONE writer; this command writes only its own receipts) →
    only a SUCCESSFUL mutation writes a receipt.
  - **Exception→envelope translation (the 0119 header's promise fulfilled):** the writer is
    exception-style, so the delegate runs in a guarded block translating its reason-prefixed
    raises (`captain_not_owned`/`ship_not_owned`/`already_assigned`/`captain_slots_full`/
    `not_assigned`) into failure envelopes; UNKNOWN exceptions RE-RAISE (never hide a bug). The
    writer returns void, so the command builds the success envelope (ok/action/ids) and stores
    it verbatim.
  - `assign_captain_to_ship(p_request_id, p_captain_instance_id, p_main_ship_id)` /
    `unassign_captain_from_ship(p_request_id, p_captain_instance_id)` — the 0113
    two-wrappers-one-command shape: auth check → **anti-probe dark gate returning the identical
    literal `{ok:false, reason:'captain_assignment_disabled'}` for every caller** → delegate
    with the fixed action. Reason-keyed client envelopes throughout (locked adaptation of
    0113's code-keyed ones, matching the 0110/0116 read-surface signal convention).
  - `captain_command_client_envelope` — 0113's `fitting_command_client_envelope` was READ FIRST
    per the slice spec: its map is coupled to fitting's reason vocabulary (0113:219–250), NOT
    feature-generic, so the captain analogue was created and is called from BOTH wrappers —
    never inlining the map twice (the exact 0113:33–35 extraction rationale). Its
    `feature_disabled` entry emits the same literal dark envelope as the wrapper gates.
  - Targeted ACLs (the 0113:305–317 block verbatim): private command + mapper revoked from
    public/anon/authenticated, granted to service_role only; the two wrappers `revoke from
    public, anon; grant execute to authenticated` (dark: both gates reject today).
  - **LOCKED DECISION (header): the settled-SAFE game rule (ship must be home/at_location) is
    NOT in this slice** — it lands NEXT slice as a forward-only amendment of this command,
    mirroring exactly how P14 shipped 0113 (command) then 0114 (settled-SAFE). Safe because
    `captain_assignment_enabled` is `'false'`: the gate rejects before any read, so no caller
    can reach the rule-less command in the gap.
- **`docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`** (same step): §1 matrix gains the `captain_assignment_receipts`
  row in the `module_fitting_receipts` row's exact shape (ONE private command for both actions so
  the ledger keeps ONE writer, PK (player_id, request_id), verbatim replay, DARK — rejects before
  any read); the §2 Captain row extended with the command/wrapper contract, the
  exception→envelope translation, the deferred settled-SAFE note, the new downward
  Reference/Config (`cfg_bool`) edge, and the inbound client edge (ONLY the two authenticated
  wrappers); `captain_assign_apply`'s "called by NOTHING yet" replaced — this command is its ONE
  caller.
- **Verify:** `npm run build` green (SQL-only slice — confirms nothing else drifted). §5
  invariant checklist re-read: `captain_assignment_receipts` has exactly ONE writing system and
  no client write path; `ship_captain_assignments` keeps `captain_assign_apply` as its only
  writer (the command only delegates); edges stay DOWNWARD/acyclic (new: Reference/Config
  `cfg_bool` read); Activity table-less; reward path and combat truth untouched; no flag flipped
  — the entire surface ships server-rejected.

## 2026-07-04 — CAPTAIN-P15 SLICE C — `ship_captain_assignments` schema + the ONE assignment writer (inert AND dark)

**Request.** Phase 15 slice C, mirroring the P14 fittings slice (0112): ONE new forward-only
migration creating the assignment junction table + the ONE structural sole writer, plus same-step
doc-sync. NO receipts, NO client commands, NO settled-SAFE rule, NO read surfaces, NO frontend,
NO adapter change, NO verify script in this slice.

**Work done:**
- **NEW `supabase/migrations/20260618000119_captain_p15_assignments_schema.sql`** (0001–0118
  unedited):
  - `ship_captain_assignments` — **the `captain_instance_id` PK IS the one-ship-per-captain
    invariant** (the exact 0112:54 shape): PK FK `captain_instances` on delete cascade ·
    `main_ship_id` FK `main_ship_instances` cascade · `player_id` FK `auth.users` cascade ·
    `assigned_at timestamptz default now()`; index on `main_ship_id` (the headcount cap + the
    future adapter's per-ship read, 0115:162–167); RLS on with the own-row SELECT policy +
    `grant select to authenticated` ONLY — no write policy/grant.
  - `captain_assign_apply(p_player_id uuid, p_captain_instance_id uuid, p_main_ship_id uuid)` —
    THE sole writer covering ALL mutations: `p_main_ship_id` NOT NULL = ASSIGN, NULL = UNASSIGN
    (the `fitting_apply` one-writer shape — two functions would be two writers). Structural
    invariants enforced in the writer, reject never clamp: captain ownership; ship read by the
    **(main_ship_id, player_id) pair** (never "the player's ship" singular — the 0079 multi-ship
    posture); truthful `already_assigned` NAMING the current ship (PK backstops — never silently
    re-homed); and the **HEADCOUNT hard cap `count(*) < captain_slots`** — the captain analogue
    of Σ slot_cost ≤ module_slots, count because slice A locked one-captain-one-slot.
    Owner-consistency guaranteed: stored `player_id` = captain owner = ship owner (the
    0115:47–50 guarantee that later lets the adapter join without a player filter). Race safety:
    the per-player `pg_advisory_xact_lock(('captain_assignment', player))` taken FIRST (the
    0112:99–103 idiom) — the count→insert window is single-writer by construction. Targeted ACL:
    revoke public/anon/authenticated, grant service_role only.
  - **Error style (locked, documented in the header):** exception-style (the 0039/0108
    internal-leaf idiom) with stable reason-prefixed messages (`captain_not_owned` /
    `ship_not_owned` / `already_assigned` / `captain_slots_full` / `not_assigned`) — a
    deliberate deviation from `fitting_apply`'s envelopes; the future command slice translates
    raised reasons into client envelopes.
  - **LOCKED DECISION (header): the settled-SAFE game rule is deliberately NOT in this
    structural writer** — the dark gate, the home/at_location spatial rule (the 0114 layer), and
    receipt idempotency all land in the later COMMAND slice, exactly as P14 split 0112
    (structure) from 0113/0114 (command + game rule). Until then nothing can call this writer
    (service_role-only, no caller exists), so the system stays inert AND dark — no row can exist
    today.
- **`docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`** (same step): §1 matrix gains the `ship_captain_assignments`
  row in the `ship_module_fittings` row's exact shape (Captain, ONE sole writer
  `captain_assign_apply` covering assign AND unassign, PK = one-ship-per-captain, headcount ≤
  `captain_slots` hard cap — reject never clamp); the §2 Captain row extended to name the new
  table + writer, the game-rule/adapter deferrals, and the system's FIRST cross-system edge:
  Captain → Main Ship (read-only ownership + `captain_slots`) — downward, acyclic, nothing
  depends on Captain.
- **Verify:** `npm run build` green (SQL-only slice — confirms nothing else drifted). §5
  invariant checklist re-read: `ship_captain_assignments` has exactly ONE writing system and no
  client write path (select-only policy/grant); the one new call edge is a downward read
  (Captain → Main Ship — graph stays acyclic, no second writer to `main_ship_instances` or any
  table); Activity stays table-less; reward path and combat source-of-truth untouched; no flag
  flipped.

---

## 2026-07-04 — CAPTAIN-P15 SLICE B — `captain_instances` schema + the single Captain mint writer (inert AND dark)

**Request.** Phase 15 slice B, mirroring the P13 instances slice (0108): ONE new forward-only
migration creating the instances table + the ONE internal-leaf sole writer, plus same-step
doc-sync. NO assignment table, NO receipts, NO commands, NO read surfaces, NO frontend, NO verify
script in this slice.

**Work done:**
- **NEW `supabase/migrations/20260618000118_captain_p15_instances_schema.sql`** (0001–0117
  unedited):
  - `captain_instances` — INDIVIDUAL rows, never counts (no quantity column by design): `id uuid`
    PK `gen_random_uuid()` · `player_id` FK `auth.users` on delete cascade · `captain_type_id` FK
    `captain_types` · **`mint_key text not null unique` (the idempotency spine)** · `created_at`;
    player index `(player_id, created_at desc)`; RLS on with the own-row SELECT policy +
    `grant select to authenticated` ONLY — no write policy/grant (the 0108:42–63 shape exactly).
    NO assignment columns — assigned-ship/slot state belongs to the later assignment slice's own
    junction table (the `ship_module_fittings` shape), forward-only there.
  - `captains_mint_instance(p_player_id uuid, p_captain_type_id text, p_mint_key text)` — THE ONE
    writer of `captain_instances` (internal leaf, SECURITY DEFINER): validates the mint key +
    catalog id with exception-style errors (no envelopes — the 0039/0108 internal-leaf idiom),
    inserts `on conflict (mint_key) do nothing`, and on replay returns the EXISTING instance id
    for that key (the 0108:95–104 idiom — the same key can never mint twice). Targeted ACL:
    revoke from public/anon/authenticated, `grant execute to service_role` only.
  - **LOCKED DECISION (recorded in the migration header): no acquisition path is built in this
    slice** — nothing calls `captains_mint_instance` yet. It is the future downward leaf for
    whatever grants captains (Phase-16 progression consuming inventory, or a later dark grant
    command), exactly as `modules_mint_instance` (0108) predated its craft command (0109) by one
    slice. The system is therefore inert AND dark: no client-reachable surface exists, and
    `captain_assignment_enabled` (0117) stays `'false'` besides — no row can exist today.
- **`docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`** (same step): §1 matrix gains the `captain_instances` row in the
  `module_instances` row's exact shape (system = Captain, sole writer = `captains_mint_instance`,
  idempotent by the NOT NULL UNIQUE `mint_key`, service_role-only internal leaf); and the **§2
  Captain system row is added NOW** — the system has its first writer, so the row is real (the
  0108 precedent; slice A had deferred it). Contract stated: owns captain instance state + the
  FUTURE assignment state, reads only its own `captain_types` catalog (downward, intra-system —
  no cross-system edge exists yet), no inbound client surface, everything dark behind
  `captain_assignment_enabled`.
- **Verify:** `npm run build` green (SQL-only slice — confirms nothing else drifted). §5
  invariant checklist re-read against the migration: `captain_instances` has exactly ONE writing
  system (the mint leaf; no client write path — select-only policy/grant); no new cross-system
  call edge (the helper reads only Captain's own catalog — graph stays acyclic); Activity stays
  table-less; reward path and combat source-of-truth untouched; no flag flipped.

## 2026-07-04 — CAPTAIN-P15 SLICE A — dark flag `captain_assignment_enabled` + the `captain_types` catalog (foundations only)

**Request.** Phase 15 "Captain instances + assignment" (ROADMAP :90) slice A, mirroring the
0107/0111 catalog+flag idiom: ONE new forward-only migration + same-step doc-sync. NO
instances/assignment/receipt tables, NO commands, NO read surfaces, NO frontend, NO verify
scripts in this slice.

**Work done:**
- **NEW `supabase/migrations/20260618000117_captain_p15_catalog_and_flag.sql`** (0001–0116
  unedited):
  - Dark flag `captain_assignment_enabled='false'` inserted into `game_config`
    `on conflict (key) do nothing` (the exact 0107:63–69 shape) — created FALSE, NOT flipped;
    every future Phase-15 RPC must check it FIRST and reject-before-any-read while false.
  - `captain_types` catalog (Reference/Config posture verbatim from 0039/0042/0107: RLS on,
    ONE public-read select policy, `grant select to anon, authenticated`, NO write
    policy/grant): text `id` PK · `name` · `specialization` with a CHECK
    ('combat','trade','exploration','mining','support') — deliberately UNLIKE 0107's
    unconstrained display-only `slot_type`, because specialization is the captain analogue of
    the module slot_type tradeoff CASE (ROADMAP law 4: never a plain sum), a constrained
    mechanism input the later adapter slice consumes · `description` ·
    `stats_json jsonb not null default '{}'` in the ONE shared stat vocabulary
    (attack/defense/repair/cargo/scan/mining/evasion + optional speed_mult_bonus —
    0115:173–180; no parallel captain vocabulary).
  - **NO `slot_cost` column** (locked decision): every assigned captain occupies exactly ONE
    slot — `main_ship_instances.captain_slots` (0043:58; starter frigate seeds 2) is a
    HEADCOUNT, not a point budget; the later adapter cap is `count(*) <= captain_slots`
    (reject, never clamp).
  - Five seeds, one per specialization, `on conflict (id) do nothing`, each clearly weaker
    than the same-role module in the 0111 band (attack 10 / cargo 25 / scan 8): combat →
    attack 4 · trade → cargo 8 · exploration → scan 3 · mining → mining 4 · support →
    repair 3. Captains complement fitting, never replace it; Phase 16 progression (consumes
    inventory) is the growth path. Conservative, not final balance.
- **`docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`** (same step): §1 matrix gains the `captain_types` row under
  the new **Captain** system in the `module_types` row's exact shape (catalog/config,
  migration-seeded only, NO runtime writer, public read-only). **The §2 Captain system row is
  deliberately DEFERRED** to the instances slice: no writer/function exists yet, and a doc must
  never describe state that isn't real (the 0111 no-Fitting-row-yet precedent). That slice adds
  it together with the first writer.
- **Verify:** `npm run build` green (SQL-only slice — confirms nothing else drifted). §5
  invariant checklist re-read against the migration: the new table is migration-seeded
  catalog/config with no runtime writer and no client write path; no new call edge (acyclic
  graph unchanged); no reward-path or combat-truth change; no flag flipped.

## 2026-07-04 — CLEANUP SLICE 4 (final, scripts-only) — auto-cleanup part 4: the trade proof scripts' five duplicated blocks extracted into the sourced `scripts/lib/trade-proof-lib.sh`

**Request.** Part 4 — the FINAL slice of the module-fitting-milestone auto-cleanup: the three
trade proof orchestrators (`trade-economy-bootstrap-proof.sh` / `trade-fleet-0c-proof.sh` /
`trade-market-1-proof.sh`) each carried near-byte-identical copies of five shell blocks. Extract
them into ONE sourced library, adopted by all three in the same step. Scripts-only — NO
migration, src/, flag, CI/workflow, or other-script change; NO change to what any proof proves.

**Work done:**
- **NEW `scripts/lib/trade-proof-lib.sh`** (sourced, never executed; sited beside the existing
  shared mjs verifier libs `verify-harness.mjs`/`verifier-teardown.mjs`) exposing the five
  blocks as functions — the header states who sources it and that NEW trade-proof scripts must
  source it rather than re-copying: `fail` + **(1)** `tp_init` (arg/usage scaffold: shell opts,
  global MODE, `usage → exit 2`), **(2)** `tp_assert_self_rolling_back` (begin;/final-ROLLBACK/
  no-COMMIT static checks — one implementation of the byte-identical block), **(3)**
  `tp_assert_flags_inside_txn` (ONE list/loop form; `trade-fleet-0c-proof.sh`'s single-flag
  inline spelling became a one-element list call — same logic per the recon), **(4)**
  `tp_assert_out_of_scope` (the identical src/-and-migrations guard), **(5)** `tp_run_local`
  (the local-mode psql + PASS-line + per-marker greps, on bootstrap's existing
  `$MARKERS`/`$PASS_LINE` interface). Feature-specific pieces stay in each caller as
  parameters/greps (SQL path, flag list, marker list, PASS line, provisioning/reject-token/
  property asserts, the selftest summary echo) — the lib never forks per caller. The one-line
  `: "${DB_URL:?…}"` env contract stays in each caller so its diagnostic keeps naming the
  script, not the lib.
- **All three scripts converted** to source the lib: 76→52 / 74→55 / 74→53 lines (net −69
  across the three; the lib is 80).

**Behavior identical — verified honestly within sandbox limits:** `bash -n` clean on all four
files (`shellcheck` is NOT available in this sandbox — stated plainly). Before/after outputs
captured for EVERY DB-free path of all three scripts — no-arg usage (exit 2), `selftest`
(DB-free static checks, exit 0), and `local` without DB_URL (exit 1): usage and selftest outputs
are BYTE-IDENTICAL; the only diff anywhere is the bash-generated line NUMBER inside the DB_URL
diagnostic (`line 66` → `line 51` etc. — the scripts got shorter; script name, message text, and
exit codes unchanged). The lib's failure paths were exercised directly on doctored SQL files
(missing begin; / missing rollback; / missing flag / src-reference) — each fires the exact
pre-change `FAIL: …` message with exit 1. The real `local` psql mode cannot be exercised here
(no disposable DB; the documented environmental precedent) — it is the same psql/grep text
verbatim, parameterized, and remains the owner/CI gate. One fail-path-only wording note: 0c's
flag-assert failure copy now uses the shared loop form ("…the dark flag
'mainship_additional_commission_enabled'…" instead of "…the dark add-ship flag…") — unreachable
on the green path and semantically identical.
- **`docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` explicitly needs NO change** — a shell-block extraction inside
  the proof harness adds no table, writer, flag, or cross-system edge; no architectural fact
  changed. **This completes the module-fitting-milestone auto-cleanup (parts 1–4).**

---

## 2026-07-04 — CLEANUP SLICE 3 (frontend) — auto-cleanup part 3: the four-way duplicated guard body extracted into `runGuardedCommand`

**Request.** Part 3 of the post-milestone auto-cleanup: the same ~20-line guarded command-submit
body (tryClaim → pending/note reset → try { await command; mounted guard; ok → note + refresh;
else → mapped error note } finally { release; conditional pending clear }) lived at FOUR call
sites — ExplorationPanel `scan`, MiningPanel `extract`, ModulesPanel `craft` and `runFitting`.
Extract it into ONE shared helper and adopt it at all four sites in the same step. NO behavior
change, no copy change, no fail-closed render-guard change; no migration/flag/script change.

**Work done:**
- **`src/lib/useActivityPanelGuards.ts`** — new exported `runGuardedCommand<R extends {ok:
  boolean}>` beside `tryClaim`/`release`/`activeRef` (the module IS the guard idiom's shared
  home; header comment extended). One options object: `{ key, guards, setPending, setNote, exec,
  successNote, errorNote, refresh }` — the body preserves the exact current semantics and ORDER
  (bail unless claimed · pending on · note cleared · exec once per accepted claim · mounted
  guard after the await · ok → success note + refresh, else → decorated error note · finally
  always releases, pending clears only while mounted). The doc comment carries the shared
  rationale (synchronous double-submit guard, mounted guard, finally-release); `Extract<R,…>`
  casts hand each callback the discriminated member (generic `R` does not narrow by `res.ok`
  alone — the isServerLit stance).
- **Four call sites converted to thin wrappers**; the site-specific pieces stay AT the sites as
  closures: the `!mainShipId` pre-guard (Exploration/Mining, before the helper); request-id
  minting moved INSIDE each site's `exec` thunk (`crypto.randomUUID()` — the runFitting idiom;
  still fresh per submit since exec runs once per accepted claim); boolean setters (scan/extract)
  vs per-row Record updaters over the fixed/per-row key (craft/runFitting); and each site's
  error decoration (mining's cooldown `~Ns`, craft's `insufficient_items` item/have/need,
  runFitting's `insufficient_slots` used/limit/needs, exploration plain). `runFitting` keeps its
  `exec`/`verb` params from JSX and forwards through the helper. Per-site scaffold comments
  trimmed to the site-specific parts; the helper's doc comment carries the shared explanation.
- **MarketPanel intentionally NOT touched** (recon-note scope): its `submit` carries an extra
  synchronous validate→release step before the await — a different posture; it adopts the helper
  on its next real change, per the established adopt-on-next-real-change rule.
- **`docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` needs NO change** — stated explicitly: a frontend-only extraction
  adds no table, writer, flag, or cross-system edge; no architectural fact changed.

**Verify (honest):** `npm run build` green (`tsc -b` + vite — typecheck included). `npm run lint`:
the four touched files are CLEAN (`npx eslint` on them exits 0); the repo-wide run reports 14
PRE-EXISTING errors, all in untouched files (`src/features/map/MainShipMarker.tsx` /
`SpaceRouteLine.tsx` / `useSpaceMoveCommand.ts` and `tests/` harness/spec files) — none
introduced by this slice. Each converted site's diff visually confirmed to preserve the
claim-key, pending/note targets, and decoration logic exactly.

**Follow-up (separate slice, NOT this step):** part 4 — shared `scripts/lib/trade-proof-lib.sh`
for the three trade proof scripts' duplicated blocks.

---

## 2026-07-04 — CLEANUP SLICE 2 (docs-only) — auto-cleanup part 2: the `fleets` commission writes recorded as the sanctioned Main-Ship shim (with retirement condition)

**Request.** Part 2 of the post-milestone auto-cleanup: the Main-Ship port-entry commission path
writes `fleets` directly — `port_entry_commission_build` (0080; called by
`port_entry_commission_writer` and the dark `commission_additional_main_ship`, 0080/0091) inserts
the commissioned ship's present/location fleet row, and `normalize_main_ship_dock` (0084)
normalizes dock state on `fleets` — while §1 named **Fleet** the sole writer with no recorded
exception. An undocumented second writer on `fleets` is a LAW-DOC DEFECT (the doc contradicted
shipped code). Docs-only — NO migration, code, script, or flag change in this step.

**DESIGN DECISION (planner authority): DOCUMENT-THE-SHIM, not the repoint migration.**
Rationale: the commission path's bodies are guarded by the FROZEN md5-pinned PORT-ENTRY
production verifiers (`normalize_main_ship_dock` and `port_entry_commission_writer` — the build
core's caller — are two of the three prosrc-md5-pinned bodies; see 0084's header and
`docs/TRADE_FLEET_0C_VERIFIER_REPOINT.md`), and the path is the ACTIVE first-ship onboarding
writer. A behavior-identical CREATE OR REPLACE purely for boundary hygiene would invalidate
deploy-gate md5 pins (a deploy-time human-gate concern) and add risk to a live path for zero
functional gain. The honest, reversible fix today is to make the law doc match reality with an
explicit retirement condition.

**Retirement condition (recorded verbatim in the §1 note):** the exception retires when the
port-entry path is next reworked for a FUNCTIONAL reason; at that point the `fleets` writes MUST
be repointed through a Fleet-exposed commission/dock function via a forward-only migration
(re-deriving the PORT-ENTRY prosrc-md5 pins at that deploy gate) and the §1 exception note
deleted.

**Work done (docs only):**
- **§1 `fleets`/`fleet_units` row** — owner cell amended in the matrix's existing long-parenthetical
  idiom: Fleet stays the sole writer EXCEPT the ONE sanctioned Main-Ship port-entry commission
  shim (the two functions above, writes confined to the calling player's OWN rows), with the
  retirement condition and the not-repointed-now rationale attached in place.
- **§2 Main Ship row** — corrected ONLY the contradicting Must-NOT clause: "touch fleets" now
  carries the "(except …)" parenthetical pointing at the §1 exception note (the Combat row's
  existing "(except request return via Movement)" idiom). The §2 Fleet row contradicts nothing
  and was not touched; verified the caller set against 0080/0084/0091 before wording.
- `npm run build` green (docs-only sanity).

**Follow-ups (separate slices, NOT this step):** part 3 — shared frontend guard helper for the
four duplicated command-submit bodies; part 4 — shared `scripts/lib/trade-proof-lib.sh` for the
three trade proof scripts.

---

## 2026-07-04 — CLEANUP SLICE 1 (docs-only) — module-fitting-milestone auto-cleanup part 1: `market_offers` law-doc sync

**Request.** Part 1 of the post-milestone auto-cleanup: fix two DOC DEFECTS in
`docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` where the law doc contradicted shipped code (0085/0087/0089/0090).
Docs-only — NO code, migration, script, or flag change in this step.

**The defects (law doc contradicted shipped code):**
- `market_offers` (shipped in 0085 as the Trade Market price catalog) had **no §1 sole-writer row
  at all** — 0085's own header claimed a SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES ownership posture that the doc never
  actually recorded.
- The §2 Trade Market row attributed the RPCs' reads to "`trade_goods` + the docked-location
  context", never mentioning `market_offers` — but ALL offer prices actually come from
  `market_offers` (`get_market_offers` projects the docked station's active offers (0087),
  `market_buy` takes its `sell_price` (0089), `market_sell` its `buy_price` (0090));
  `trade_goods` genuinely provides only good identity/metadata (`unit_volume_m3` for the
  buy-side volume check, 0089 — `market_sell` reads it not at all).

**Work done (docs only):**
- **§1 ownership matrix** — added the `market_offers` row directly after its sibling catalog
  `trade_goods`, following that row's exact Reference/Config idiom:
  owner **Reference/Config** (admin/migration; Trade Market price catalog — migration-seeded only
  (0085, idempotent seed), NO runtime writer) · read = public read-only (RLS public-read policy,
  no client write path).
- **§2 Trade Market row** — corrected ONLY the reading clause: prices now attributed to
  `market_offers` (read by all three RPCs as above); `trade_goods` kept for what it still truly
  provides (good identity/metadata — `unit_volume_m3` for the buy-side volume check). Nothing
  else in §2 touched.
- Verified against 0085/0087/0089/0090 before wording; `npm run build` green (docs-only sanity).

**Follow-ups (separate slices, NOT this step):** part 2 — commission-writer repoint decision
(`port_entry_commission_build` / `normalize_main_ship_dock` write `fleets` directly while §1
names Fleet its sole writer); part 3 — shared frontend guard helper for the four duplicated
command-submit bodies (ExplorationPanel `scan` / MiningPanel `extract` / ModulesPanel `craft` +
`runFitting`); part 4 — shared `scripts/lib/trade-proof-lib.sh` for the three trade proof
scripts' duplicated blocks.

## 2026-07-04 — FITTING-P14 SLICE G (final) — `verify:fitting` dark-posture script. **Phase 14 Module fitting — dark implementation complete (slices A–G)**

**Request.** Implement slice G, the last Phase 14 slice: the dark-posture verify script + its
`package.json` entry, mirroring the P13 slice-F verifier exactly (read end-to-end first:
`verify-modules.mjs`, `scripts/lib/verify-harness.mjs`, `scripts/lib/verifier-teardown.mjs`, the
package.json verify cluster). Touches ONLY `scripts/verify-fitting.mjs`, `package.json`, this
file, and the recon scratch file. No migrations (head stays **0116**), no CI/workflow edits, no
flags.

**Flag-handling mechanism — the twins', stated and followed exactly.** The script NEVER writes
`game_config` and NEVER flips `module_fitting_enabled` — dark contracts only (the
`verify-mining.mjs:16–20` mechanism; the `set_game_config` flip in `verify-mainship-send.mjs` is
the explicitly-NOT-copied alternative). Lit-path behaviors live in the HUMAN ACTIVATION CHECKLIST
below — run on a DEV database by the owner, never by this script. Teardown: the shared
`teardownVerifier` deletes the throwaway user (the 0112/0113 player FKs cascade its rows away); no
flag entry is passed — nothing to restore, `module_fitting_enabled` stays exactly as found.

**Work done:**
- **NEW `scripts/verify-fitting.mjs`** — shared harness imports from day one
  (`Abort`/`createReporter`/`createUserFactory`/`resolveEnv` + `teardownVerifier`) — ZERO inline
  harness copies. Service key OPTIONAL (teardown only); one throwaway signup. Asserts, in the
  twins' order/idioms:
  (1) **dark rejection** — authenticated `fit_module_to_ship` AND `unfit_module_from_ship` →
  `{ok:false, code:'feature_disabled'}` with syntactically VALID uuids/request_ids passed, so the
  identical dark answer proves the 0113 anti-probe gate fires BEFORE any validation; and
  `get_my_ship_fittings` → `{ok:false, reason:'module_fitting_disabled'}` (0116);
  (2) **catalog contract (0111, exact)** — `module_types.slot_cost`/`stats_json` publicly
  readable; the four archetypes' seeds verbatim (autocannon 1/`{"attack":10}` · thruster
  1/`{"evasion":3,"speed_mult_bonus":0.1}` · cargo lattice 2/`{"cargo":25}` · sensor
  1/`{"scan":8}`) and every `slot_cost >= 1` — public-read IS the posture assertion (the P13
  inversion note applies);
  (3) **player-state RLS + no client write path** — fresh user sees 0 rows in
  `ship_module_fittings` + `module_fitting_receipts`; inserts denied on both;
  (4) **internal surfaces locked** — `fitting_apply`, `fitting_execute_command`, and
  `fitting_command_client_envelope` denied to the authenticated client; the three public RPCs
  denied to anon;
  (5) **config presence (read-only)** — `module_fitting_enabled` = false via the same
  jsonb-storage-tolerant comparison.
- **`package.json`** — `"verify:fitting": "node scripts/verify-fitting.mjs"` added directly after
  `verify:modules`, same command shape.
- **CI note:** the exploration/mining/modules verifiers are wired into NO workflow file — nothing
  to mirror, and no workflow was created or modified. Wiring `verify:fitting` into CI, if desired,
  is a human / PR-review step.
- **Verify posture run honestly:** `node --check scripts/verify-fitting.mjs` parses clean;
  `npm run build` green. `node scripts/verify-fitting.mjs` in this sandbox aborts at the throwaway
  SIGNUP step with the environmental TLS failure ("fetch failed / unable to verify the first
  certificate") — `node scripts/verify-modules.mjs` aborts at the IDENTICAL point in the SAME run
  (the P12/P13 precedent), so this is the known environmental-fail-only posture and reaching that
  identical abort point proves the harness wiring. The assertions themselves run against a real DB
  in the owner's environment.
- `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` needs NO change this slice — confirmed and stated (the P12/P13
  verify-slice precedent): a read-only verifier script + one npm alias adds no table, writer, or
  cross-system edge.

---

### Phase 14 Module fitting — dark implementation complete (slices A–G) — closing summary

- **Migrations `0111–0116`** (head **0110 → 0116**; all forward-only; `0001–0110` never edited):
  `0111` config/flag + stats catalog (`module_fitting_enabled='false'` + `module_types.slot_cost`/
  `stats_json` with the four seeded archetypes) · `0112` the fittings table + THE ONE writer
  (`ship_module_fittings` with the `module_instance_id` PK-as-invariant + `fitting_apply`,
  service_role-only) · `0113` the two-layer command (`module_fitting_receipts` +
  `fit_module_to_ship`/`unfit_module_from_ship` → private `fitting_execute_command`;
  dark-gate-first, lock-before-replay, trade-semantics verbatim replay, failure-writes-no-receipt)
  · `0114` the settled-SAFE rule correction (`ship_not_home` → `ship_not_settled`) · `0115` the
  adapter integration (fitted modules feed `calculate_expedition_stats` under the `module_slots`
  hard cap; +`module_slots_used`/`module_slots_limit`) · `0116` the read surface
  (`get_my_ship_fittings`).
- **Frontend:** the fitting section EXTENDS `src/features/modules/` (types/api/panel + the
  `mainshipApi.ts` `fetchMyMainShips` list variant) — double-gated server-driven visibility,
  fails closed to nothing; per-instance fit/unfit controls with display-only slot arithmetic.
- **Verify:** `scripts/verify-fitting.mjs` + `npm run verify:fitting` (dark posture only, shared
  harness, never flips flags).
- **Locked design decisions (each with its one-line rationale):**
  1. **Fitting is a NEW leaf system** (ROADMAP law 5 "Fitting=modules") owning
     `ship_module_fittings` + `module_fitting_receipts` — never a second writer or new columns on
     `module_instances`.
  2. **ONE writer for BOTH mutations** (`fitting_apply`: ship = FIT, null = UNFIT) — one sole
     writer per table covers ALL its mutations; two functions would be two writers.
  3. **ONE private command for both actions** (`fitting_execute_command`) — so the receipts table
     keeps ONE sole writer.
  4. **Capacity hard-reject + slot_type tradeoffs, never a raw sum** — Σ `slot_cost` ≤
     `module_slots` enforced at fit time AND re-checked in the adapter (raise, never clamp — the
     0044 mechanism); weapon/cargo/sensor tradeoffs mirror the role rules.
  5. **`stats_json` reuses the `base_stats_json` idiom** (same seven keys through the SAME
     accumulators) **+ `speed_mult_bonus`** applied before penalties — one stat pipeline.
  6. **Settled-SAFE rule (C2 correction)** — the 0113 `'home'` literal was dead-on-arrival (no
     writer produces it); 0114 ships the 0100/0105 SAFE state set + the 0099/0104 companion
     machinery (intent preserved, literal fixed, precedent reused).
  7. **Extend-not-duplicate frontend** — the fitting UI lives in ModulesPanel (which already lists
     instances); consequence: double-gated, renders nothing while either flag is dark.
  8. **Two deliberate read-surface omissions** (0116) — no catalog RPC (public-read direct
     selects) and no ship `module_slots` in the RPC (limits come from the client's own
     `main_ship_instances` rows / `get_my_expedition_preview`).
- **Ownership/edges recap:** all DOWNWARD/acyclic — Fitting → Modules (read) · Main Ship (read,
  incl. the OSN context helpers) · Reference/Config (read); inbound only the adapter's 0115 READ.
  Sole writers: `ship_module_fittings` = `fitting_apply` (called only by `fitting_execute_command`)
  · `module_fitting_receipts` = `fitting_execute_command` (via the two wrappers). SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES
  §1/§2 synced in the SAME step as every fact change.
- **HUMAN ACTIVATION CHECKLIST (the owner's gate — never this loop):** (1) apply migrations
  0111–0116 to the target DB; (2) run `npm run verify:fitting` there — expect ALL dark-posture
  checks green; (3) optionally flip `module_fitting_enabled='true'` on a DEV database and exercise
  the lit path: craft (or service-role-mint) module instances, then fit within slots → success AND
  the adapter stats change with the tradeoffs visible in `get_my_expedition_preview`
  (attack/evasion/cargo/scan up; pirate_attention/speed per the slot_type rules;
  `module_slots_used/limit` correct); an over-capacity fit (e.g. 2× cargo lattice + autocannon =
  5 > 3) → `insufficient_slots` with `{used, cost, limit}` and NOTHING written; a fit/unfit while
  the ship is in_space/in_transit → `ship_not_settled`; `already_fitted` (naming the current ship)
  and `not_fitted` codes fire; REPLAY the same (player, request_id) → the verbatim envelope +
  `idempotent_replay:true` and provably NO double-fit; unfit → the adapter stats revert;
  `verify:phase8`, `verify:mainship-preview`, and `verify:m2/m3/m4/m45` all stay green throughout;
  then flip the flag back and decide production activation separately. The loop ships everything
  server-rejected; activation is exclusively the human's.

**State.** `npm run build` green; `node --check` clean on the new script. Migration head **0116**;
`module_fitting_enabled='false'` everywhere; no flag flipped, no live DB write, no workflow
touched. **Phase 14 Module fitting is implemented DARK end-to-end and PR-ready on
`autopilot/20260703-064048`** — SAFE FOR HUMAN MERGE REVIEW; `main` untouched.

---

## 2026-07-04 — FITTING-P14 SLICE F — dark frontend: the fitting section EXTENDS `src/features/modules/` (fit/unfit controls inside ModulesPanel; renders nothing while either flag is dark). Frontend only — no migration

**Request.** Implement slice F: the dark fitting UI as a minimal extension of the existing
`src/features/modules/` feature. NO migration (head stays **0116**), no config, no verify script.
Read end-to-end first: `modulesTypes.ts` / `modulesApi.ts` / `ModulesPanel.tsx`, the shared
`src/lib/useActivityPanelGuards.ts`, the `GalaxyMapScreen.tsx` mounting, the `mainshipApi.ts`
ship-reading convention, and the twins' `crypto.randomUUID()` request-id idiom.

**DECISION — EXTEND, don't duplicate (locked):** the fitting UI extends `ModulesPanel` rather than
adding a parallel panel, because the panel already lists the player's module instances and a second
panel would duplicate that list (the no-duplication rule). **CONSEQUENCE (recorded honestly): the
fitting section is server-gated TWICE** — it renders only when the CRAFTING read surface is lit
(the panel's existing `isServerLit` gate on `get_my_module_instances`, `module_crafting_enabled`)
AND `get_my_ship_fittings` answers ok (`module_fitting_enabled`) — it fails closed both ways and
renders NOTHING today. With both flags `'false'` the fittings RPC is not even called (it rides the
lit branch); with crafting lit and fitting dark, every fitting element is behind a
`litFittings &&` gate, so the rendered output is exactly the pre-slice-F markup.

**Work done (4 files, all existing modules — no new feature dir, no GalaxyMapScreen change):**
- **`modulesTypes.ts`** — added the fitting types: `ShipFittingRow` (the seven 0116 fields) +
  `GetMyShipFittingsResult`; `FittingCommandResult` (the 0113/0114 wrapper envelopes — success
  passes the writer's fitted/unfitted + slot facts through with the replay flag; failure carries
  code/message with the real `insufficient_slots` `{used, cost, limit}` and `already_fitted`
  `{main_ship_id}` context); and the `FITTING_ERROR_COPY` map + `fittingErrorMessage()` covering
  `feature_disabled` / `invalid_request` / `ship_not_settled` / `module_not_owned` /
  `ship_not_owned` / `already_fitted` / `not_fitted` / `insufficient_slots` /
  `not_authenticated` / `unavailable`. The read reason `module_fitting_disabled` is handled by
  fail-closed rendering, not copy (stated in the section header).
- **`modulesApi.ts`** — three thin wrappers in the existing envelope idiom (transport error →
  normalized failure, never a throw into the render path): `getMyShipFittings()`,
  `fitModuleToShip(moduleInstanceId, mainShipId, requestId)`,
  `unfitModuleFromShip(moduleInstanceId, requestId)`.
- **`mainshipApi.ts`** — minimal extension INSIDE the existing module (never a second ship-select
  elsewhere): the ship column list was extracted to `SHIP_COLS` (now used by both selects) and
  `fetchMyMainShips()` added — the multi-ship-ready LIST variant of `fetchMyMainShip` (same
  owner-read RLS, same columns incl. `module_slots`; `[]` on error, non-fatal).
- **`ModulesPanel.tsx`** — the fitting section: `getMyShipFittings()` rides the existing lit-branch
  read batch (mount + `lifecycleKey`); ships fetched only once fitting is lit. Per instance row
  (all double-gated): fitted state joined from the fittings result by `module_instance_id`
  ("Fitted → <ship name>" + an Unfit control), or a fit control — ship picker over the player's
  ships labeled `name (Σ slot_cost used / module_slots)` computed from the already-loaded fittings
  data (**display-only arithmetic; `fitting_apply`'s hard cap + the 0114 settled-SAFE rule remain
  the enforcer**, commented in place) + a Fit button. Each command generates a fresh
  `crypto.randomUUID()` request id (the twins' idiom; the server dedups on (player_id,
  request_id)), claims the row synchronously via the shared `tryClaim(instance_id)` (craft rows
  key by catalog slug, fitting rows by instance uuid — the key spaces cannot collide, noted),
  disables the row while in flight, renders the server's message (falling back to the copy map,
  with the real `{used, cost, limit}` suffix on `insufficient_slots` — the insufficient_items
  idiom), and refetches instances + fittings on success. One shared `runFitting()` executes both
  commands (no duplicated submit block).

**Doc-sync note.** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` needs NO change — confirmed and stated (the
MODULES-P13 SLICE E precedent): frontend-only; no table, no writer, no cross-system edge; the
client reads/commands only through the shipped RPCs (0113/0114/0116) and the existing owner-read
selects.

**State.** `npm run build` green (tsc -b + vite, exit 0 — this slice DOES touch src; one TS error
was caught and fixed during the slice: a double-wrapped `Promise<ReturnType<…>>` in the shared
submit helper's type). Targeted eslint on all four touched files: exit 0. **Dark-render trace
(manual, per the request):** with both flags `'false'` the panel's first read returns
`module_crafting_disabled` → `isServerLit` false → the panel renders `null`, byte-identical to
before this slice (the fittings RPC is never called); with crafting lit + fitting dark every added
element is behind `litFittings &&` → the instances list renders the exact pre-slice markup.
Migration head stays **0116**; `module_fitting_enabled='false'`; nothing flipped, no live DB
write, no workflow touched. PR-ready on `autopilot/20260703-064048`, `main` untouched. Next:
slice G (`scripts/verify-fitting.mjs` + the `verify:fitting` package.json entry).

## 2026-07-04 — FITTING-P14 SLICE E — the dark read surface `0116` (`get_my_ship_fittings()`). **Server side of Phase 14 complete, fully dark**

**Request.** Implement slice E: ONE new forward-only migration with the read surface, mirroring the
modules read surface (0110, the 0101/0106 family) — re-read end-to-end first. NO write path, NO new
table, NO frontend, NO verify script this slice; flag stays `'false'`.

**Work done — NEW `supabase/migrations/20260618000116_fitting_p14_read_surface.sql`** (migration
head moves **0115 → 0116**; `0001–0115` unedited):
- **`get_my_ship_fittings()`** — the 0110 body idiom (jsonb envelope · `stable` ·
  `security definer` · `set search_path = public` · jsonb_agg row shape + coalesce-to-`[]` ·
  `{ok:true, fittings:[…]}` plural envelope), with ONE deliberate divergence recorded in the
  header: **the dark gate runs FIRST, then auth** (0110 checks auth first) per the slice spec —
  `{ok:false, reason:'module_fitting_disabled'}` identically for every caller while dark (the
  frontend's server-driven visibility signal; anon has no execute grant anyway), then the 0110
  `not_authenticated` posture. Per row: `module_instance_id`, `main_ship_id`, `fitted_at`,
  `module_type_id`, plus the catalog display fields the future panel needs (`name`, `slot_type`,
  `slot_cost`), joined DOWNWARD via `module_instances` to `module_types`; ordered `fitted_at` desc
  **then `module_instance_id`** (determinism — the 0110 ordering idiom + a uuid tiebreak since
  several fittings can share a timestamp). Rows are scoped `player_id = auth.uid()` IN THE QUERY
  (defense in depth over the 0112 own-row RLS, as 0110 does).
- **NO catalog RPC** (the 0110 stance restated in the header): `module_types` (incl. the 0111
  `slot_cost`/`stats_json`) is a public-read Reference/Config catalog read by direct client
  select — an RPC would duplicate an already-public surface.
- **DECISION — deliberately NO ship `module_slots` in this RPC** (recorded so the omission is
  never read as forgotten): the slot LIMIT belongs to the ship, not the fitting rows — the client
  reads its own `main_ship_instances` rows (the 0043 own-row grant covers `module_slots`) or
  `get_my_expedition_preview` (whose stats carry `module_slots_used`/`module_slots_limit` since
  0115). The surface stays dumb — fitting rows only.
- **ACL (0110:72–75 verbatim):** execute revoked from public/anon, granted to authenticated only —
  and dark today: the gate rejects every call while `module_fitting_enabled='false'`. Table RLS
  unchanged.

**Doc-sync (same step).** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`: the §2 Fitting row gained
`get_my_ship_fittings()` with its gate-first semantics, the no-catalog-RPC stance, and the
no-ship-limit decision. The **§1 matrix is UNCHANGED — confirmed and stated**: no new table, no new
writer (the 0101/0106/0110 precedent: read surfaces are recorded in the §2 system row, not the
matrix).

**State.** `npm run build` green (no `src/` change was made — confirmed). Migration head **0116**;
`module_fitting_enabled='false'` everywhere. **The server side of Phase 14 Module fitting is
COMPLETE (slices A–E) and fully dark end-to-end:** the flag + stats catalog (0111), the fittings
table + THE ONE writer (0112), the two-layer fit/unfit command + receipts (0113, settled-SAFE rule
0114), the adapter integration (0115), and the read surface (0116) — every client-reachable
surface server-rejects while the flag is false; the writer/command internals are
service_role-only. No flag flipped, no live DB write, no workflow touched. **DB-apply posture
(honest, unchanged):** no psql/docker/supabase CLI in this sandbox — the migration was
hand-verified line-by-line against 0110 at the idioms cited above; live assertions run in the
owner's environment and will be covered by the slice-G `verify:fitting` dark-posture script.
PR-ready on `autopilot/20260703-064048`, `main` untouched. Next: slice F (dark frontend
`src/features/fitting/` or a minimal `src/features/modules/` extension), then slice G
(`scripts/verify-fitting.mjs` + the `verify:fitting` entry).

---

## 2026-07-04 — FITTING-P14 SLICE D — stats integration `0115` (fitted modules feed `calculate_expedition_stats` under the `module_slots` hard cap; re-create of the 0044 adapter)

**Request.** Implement slice D: ONE new forward-only migration re-creating the stat adapter so
fitted modules feed expedition stats via capacity/tradeoff — ROADMAP law 4's "replace the SOURCE
of stats … capacity + tradeoffs, never a plain sum", now real for modules. NO frontend, NO verify
script, NO wrapper/writer/receipts change this slice. Read first, end-to-end: `0044` (the function
being re-created), `0049` (its only live caller), and BOTH pinning scripts.

**What the pinning scripts actually assert (checked, not assumed):**
- `verify-phase8.mjs` asserts specific field VALUES (empty loadout → `support_capacity_used 0`,
  `limit 10`, `combat_power 0`, `speed 1`, `cargo_capacity` = ship's; per-craft deltas;
  rejection/exception cases; determinism = two identical calls compared to each other; ship +
  inventory not mutated) and LIST-membership finiteness over its `NUM_FIELDS` array (`:38–39`,
  `.every(...)`) — it never asserts an exact key SET, so ADDING keys is safe.
- `verify-mainship-preview.mjs` (reported per the request): asserts envelope/value checks only —
  `has_ship`/`valid` flags, `stats.support_capacity_limit === 10`/`used === 0`/`combat_power === 0`
  (`:52–54`), `used === 3` + `combat_power > 0` for one missile_boat (`:56–58`), over-capacity →
  `valid:false` with an error message matching `/capacity/i` (`:60–62` — the support-capacity
  exception text is unchanged, so this still matches), unknown craft → `valid:false`, no-ship →
  hull-teaser fields, preview-writes-nothing, and the adapter still denied to clients. It also
  never asserts an exact key set — additive keys are safe here too.

**Work done — NEW `supabase/migrations/20260618000115_fitting_p14_stats_adapter.sql`**
(migration head moves **0114 → 0115**; `0001–0114` unedited): `create or replace
calculate_expedition_stats` — SAME signature, support-craft path byte-identical, and the module
feed ADDED between the loadout capacity check and the final jsonb build:
1. **Read** the ship's fit set: `ship_module_fittings` (for `v_ship.main_ship_id`) →
   `module_instances` → `module_types` (`slot_cost`/`slot_type`/`stats_json` — the 0111 columns'
   FIRST code consumer). Pure downward read; no player filter needed — the existing owned-ship
   read plus `fitting_apply`'s owner-consistency invariant (0112) guarantee the fit set is the
   player's (commented in place).
2. **Capacity** — 0044:112–115 verbatim: `Σ slot_cost > v_ship.module_slots` → `raise exception`.
   Defense-in-depth: fit-time enforcement in `fitting_apply` is primary; the adapter still refuses
   to compute from an over-capacity state rather than clamp or trust it.
3. **Contributions** into the SAME accumulators the loadout loop uses
   (a_combat/a_survival/a_repair/a_cargo/a_scout/a_mining/a_retreat), exact key list
   attack/defense/repair/cargo/scan/mining/evasion, coalesced to 0 — one stat pipeline, no
   parallel module pipeline.
4. **Speed** — Σ `speed_mult_bonus` applied BEFORE penalties (the slice-A locked model):
   `round(greatest(0.2, v_speed * (1 + v_mod_speed_bonus) * (1 - a_spd_pen)), 3)` — floor and
   rounding untouched; zero modules reduces the expression to 0044's exactly.
5. **Tradeoffs (numbers + rationale, recorded):** slot_type CASE × `slot_cost` (the module
   analogue of ×qty) — **weapon** → attention +2·cost, speed_pen +0.03·cost; **cargo** →
   attention +2·cost, speed_pen +0.04·cost; **sensor** → attention +1·cost; **engine** → no
   tradeoff. Rationale: weapons/cargo mirror the 0044 combat_damage/cargo role tradeoffs — more
   firepower / a bigger hold draws pirates and slows the burn; active sensors emit (attention
   only); the engine's cost is the slot itself. Unknown/future slot_types contribute stats but no
   tradeoff (CASE else 0 — 0044's permissive unmatched-role posture). No activity-tag warning for
   modules — `module_types` has no `activity_tags` column.
6. **Output** — exactly two added keys, `module_slots_used`/`module_slots_limit`, mirroring the
   support-capacity pair. **THE COMPATIBILITY CONTRACT:** a ship with no fitted modules returns
   today's values for every pre-existing key — which is what keeps verify:phase8 /
   verify:mainship-preview green; and no fitted module can exist anywhere until the owner flips
   the dark flag.
- **ACL** re-asserted with the targeted idiom (0084/0113/0114 posture; same end state 0044
  established: service_role only, never clients — `get_my_expedition_preview` (0049) remains the
  one client path and needs no change: it passes the adapter's jsonb through, so the two new keys
  simply appear in previews).

**Doc-sync (same step).** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`: §4 item 8 (stat adapter) now records the
0115 extension — reads `ship_module_fittings`+`module_instances`+`module_types` downward
read-only, enforces BOTH hard caps (raise, never clamp), same accumulators + speed bonus, the two
added keys, the zero-module compatibility contract; the §2 Fitting row's "future adapter edge"
note became the real shipped edge (Expedition-stats → Fitting is a READ by the adapter; nothing
writes through Fitting but its own command). Still acyclic; the adapter owns no table.

**State.** `npm run build` green (no `src/` change was made — confirmed). Migration head **0115**;
`module_fitting_enabled='false'` — the adapter change is inert today (no fitting rows can exist
while the command surface is dark, so every caller sees pre-0115 values plus `module_slots_used:0`
/`module_slots_limit`). No flag flipped, no live DB write, no workflow touched. **DB-apply posture
(honest, unchanged):** no psql/docker/supabase CLI in this sandbox — the re-created function was
mechanically diffed against 0044 (only the stated additions: declares, the module block, the two
speed-line/output changes) and the pinning scripts were read end-to-end as reported above; live
assertions run in the owner's environment (`verify:phase8` + `verify:mainship-preview` must stay
green there) and the later `verify:fitting` covers the dark posture. PR-ready on
`autopilot/20260703-064048`, `main` untouched. Next: the read surface + frontend + `verify:fitting`.

## 2026-07-04 — FITTING-P14 SLICE C2 — settled-SAFE ship-state rule `0114` (corrects the 0113 `'home'` literal; `ship_not_home` → `ship_not_settled`)

**Request.** Forward-only correction of the slice-C game rule, while everything is still dark: the
strict `spatial_state = 'home'` literal was confirmed dead-on-arrival (NO shipped writer ever
produces `'home'` — commissions land `at_location`, OSN writers produce
in_transit/in_space/at_location, destruction/repair leave NULL), so even a flag flip would strand
the feature behind another migration. **Rationale (one line): intent preserved, literal fixed,
precedent reused** — the rule's INTENT ("loadout never changes mid-transit/in-space/mid-combat")
stands; only the accepted-state literal was wrong; the codebase's authoritative "settled and safe
to act on" definition is reused. No flag touched, nothing activated — a design correction within
the loop's authority.

**The shipped gating, as read first (transcribed in `FITTING_P14_RECON.local.md` §6b):** the
scan/extract COMMANDS (0099:151–167 / 0104:124–140) gate IDENTICALLY to each other — no
stricter-of-two choice was needed: `mainship_space_validate_context` must be ok, its validated
state must be `'in_space'` exactly, then `mainship_space_assert_cross_domain_exclusion` (no active
legacy movement / coordinate-pointer mismatch / presence conflict) must be ok. Their `'in_space'`
state exists because scan/extract ARE open-space actions — transcribing that literal into fitting
would contradict the recorded intent, so it deliberately does NOT transfer. The settled-SAFE STATE
SET is the securing processors' (0100:231 / 0105:69): `spatial_state in ('home','at_location')`.
**What ships: the processors' state set verbatim + the commands' companion machinery verbatim** —
`validate_context` ok AND state in `('home','at_location')`, then `cross_domain_exclusion` ok — so
fitting is gated AT LEAST as strictly as the shipped activity commands. Every non-settled outcome
(legacy NULL, in_space, in_transit, destroyed, incoherent context, busy in either movement domain)
collapses to ONE truthful reject **`ship_not_settled`** (the 0099:159 "one truthful reason" idiom).
Satisfiable today: commissioned ships sit `at_location` in the canonical coherent shape.

**Work done — NEW `supabase/migrations/20260618000114_fitting_p14_settled_safe_rule.sql`**
(migration head moves **0113 → 0114**; `0001–0113` unedited; 0113 stays as history):
- **`fitting_execute_command` re-created** (the 0044-style `create or replace` forward-only idiom)
  changing ONLY the step-6 game rule: the affected ship is resolved per action first (fit → the
  owner-checked target, `ship_not_owned` unchanged; unfit → the currently-fitted ship, rule
  skipped when no fitting row exists so the writer still answers `module_not_owned`/`not_fitted`
  truthfully), then ONE shared settled-SAFE check block runs. Dark-gate order, request_id
  validation, per-player lock, verbatim replay, action-shape validation, delegation to
  `fitting_apply`, and failure-writes-no-receipt semantics are byte-identical to 0113 (the only
  other diff: the declare block swaps `v_state` for `v_check_ship`/`v_val`/`v_excl`).
  **NO-DUPLICATION NOTE (explicit, per the review):** the settled-SAFE mechanism appears ONCE
  (resolve-then-check), so no shared-helper extraction is needed — and the membership check itself
  is one line.
- **`fitting_command_client_envelope` re-created** only because it embeds the renamed code + copy:
  `ship_not_settled` with the message "The ship must be settled at home or docked at a location to
  change its module loadout." (matching the existing copy tone); every other line identical.
  Repo grep confirms NO other site references `ship_not_home` (0113 itself is history; no
  frontend/verify script exists yet).
- **ACL re-asserted** for both re-created functions exactly as 0113 (revoke public/anon/
  authenticated + grant service_role — `create or replace` preserves grants, but the shipped
  re-create precedents re-assert explicitly). `fitting_apply`, `module_fitting_receipts`, both
  wrappers, and every exploration/mining object are NOT touched.

**Doc-sync (same step).** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` §2 Fitting row: the ⚠ unsatisfiable-rule
note is replaced by the settled-SAFE rule as now shipped (citing the 0099/0104 machinery +
0100/0105 state-set precedents), and the edges line now records the OSN-context-helper reads
(`mainship_space_validate_context` + `mainship_space_assert_cross_domain_exclusion` — read-only,
downward, the exact 0099/0104 reuse-never-reinvent posture; still acyclic, still nothing depends
on Fitting).

**State.** `npm run build` green (no `src/` change was made — confirmed). Migration head **0114**;
`module_fitting_enabled='false'` — the surface stays server-rejected at every layer; no flag
flipped, no live DB write, no workflow touched. **DB-apply posture (honest, unchanged):** no
psql/docker/supabase CLI in this sandbox — the re-created functions were diffed line-by-line
against 0113 (single-rule change + declares + the two mapper lines) and the new rule block against
0099:151–167/0104:124–140 (machinery) and 0100:231/0105:69 (state set); live assertions run in the
owner's environment and will be covered by the later `verify:fitting` dark-posture script.
PR-ready on `autopilot/20260703-064048`, `main` untouched. Next: the adapter slice and/or the read
surface, then frontend + `verify:fitting`.

## 2026-07-04 — FITTING-P14 SLICE C — the dark two-layer fit/unfit command `0113` (`module_fitting_receipts` + `fit_module_to_ship`/`unfit_module_from_ship` → ONE private `fitting_execute_command`)

**Request.** Implement slice C of Phase 14: ONE new forward-only migration with the player-scoped
fitting-receipt ledger and the dark two-layer fit/unfit command, delegating every mutation to the
0112 writer. NO frontend, NO adapter change, NO verify script this slice. Idioms matched by
re-reading the shipped sources end-to-end first: `0109` (the two-layer craft command this slice
mirrors verbatim — receipts posture, gate order, lock-before-replay, trade-semantics replay,
failure-writes-no-receipt, envelopes, relock), `0112` (the writer being wired), `0054`/`0055`
(the exact `spatial_state` values + constraints).

**Work done — NEW `supabase/migrations/20260618000113_fitting_p14_fit_command.sql`**
(migration head moves **0112 → 0113**; `0001–0112` unedited):
- **`module_fitting_receipts`** — Fitting-owned per-player idempotency ledger: **PK
  (player_id, request_id)** (the locked keying — the idempotency key IS the row identity; 0109
  used a surrogate receipt_id + a UNIQUE on the same pair, same semantics), `action` check in
  ('fit','unfit'), the request fingerprint (`module_instance_id` FK cascade, `main_ship_id` FK
  cascade nullable — as-requested, NULL on unfit; the 0088/0109 order-safe-cascade lesson), and
  **`result_json`** — the writer's success envelope stored VERBATIM. RLS = the 0109 posture
  verbatim: owner-read select only, no write path. No extra index (the PK leads on player_id —
  the 0086/0109 comment idiom).
- **DECISION — ONE private command for BOTH actions:**
  `fitting_execute_command(p_player, p_action, p_module_instance_id, p_main_ship_id, p_request_id)`
  (service_role-only) handles 'fit' AND 'unfit' precisely so the receipts table keeps **ONE sole
  writer** — a fit-command and an unfit-command each inserting receipts would be TWO writers on
  one table. Order of operations mirrors 0109 exactly: **dark gate FIRST**
  (`module_fitting_enabled` via `cfg_bool`, reject-before-any-read, `feature_disabled`) →
  request_id validation (text, non-empty, ≤200) → **per-player advisory lock BEFORE the replay
  check** using the SAME `('module_fitting', player)` key as `fitting_apply` (documented:
  `pg_advisory_xact_lock` is reentrant within a transaction, so the writer's nested acquisition is
  safe and the replay check is serialized with ALL fitting mutations — a same-request_id race
  resolves to one mutation + one verbatim replay) → **verbatim replay** (an existing
  (player, request_id) receipt returns its stored `result_json` + `idempotent_replay:true`; NO
  payload-conflict check — the 0089/0095/0109 trade semantics: a reused request_id replays the
  original result even if the call names a different action/module/ship) → action-shape validation
  ('fit' requires a ship, 'unfit' forbids one → `invalid_request`) → **the GAME RULE this layer
  owns** (below) → delegate to `fitting_apply` (NEVER touching `ship_module_fittings` directly —
  the sole-writer law; writer reasons `module_not_owned`/`ship_not_owned`/`already_fitted`/
  `not_fitted`/`insufficient_slots` pass through) → **only a SUCCESSFUL mutation writes a receipt**
  (failures write nothing — the 0109 law).
- **THE HOME-ONLY GAME RULE (`ship_not_home`).** The affected ship — `p_main_ship_id` on fit; the
  currently-fitted ship (read from `ship_module_fittings`, owner-scoped) on unfit — must have
  `spatial_state = 'home'`. RATIONALE (recorded per the locked spec): constrained state
  transitions — a loadout must never change mid-transit / in-space / mid-combat; expedition stats
  are frozen for the duration of an expedition; refitting happens at home before departure.
  Fail-closed (`is distinct from 'home'`): NULL (legacy) and every other state reject. ⚠ **AS-SHIPPED
  HONESTY NOTE (for the human activation review):** grep of all migrations shows NO shipped writer
  ever sets `spatial_state = 'home'` — commissions insert ships `at_location` (0072/0077/0078/0080),
  OSN writers produce `in_transit`/`in_space`/`at_location`, destruction/repair leave NULL (0059) —
  so with current writers EVERY existing ship answers `ship_not_home` even once the flag flips.
  Implemented as the strict locked reading; relaxing to the 0100/0105 settled-SAFE set
  (`in ('home','at_location')`) or adding a `'home'` writer is a forward-only HUMAN decision.
- **TWO thin authenticated wrappers** (0109 wrapper idiom; named per ROADMAP `:89`):
  `fit_module_to_ship(p_module_instance_id, p_main_ship_id, p_request_id)` and
  `unfit_module_from_ship(p_module_instance_id, p_request_id)` — each does auth resolution + the
  anti-probe dark-gate-first check exactly like `craft_module`, then calls the private command with
  its fixed action. **Adaptation (the no-duplication hard rule):** 0109 inlined its reason→
  code/message map in its single wrapper; two wrappers would duplicate that block, so it is
  extracted ONCE as `fitting_command_client_envelope(jsonb)` (pure jsonb→jsonb; service_role-only
  surface) and both wrappers call it. Codes covered: `feature_disabled`, `not_authenticated`,
  `invalid_request`, `ship_not_home`, `module_not_owned`, `ship_not_owned`, `already_fitted`
  (+`main_ship_id` context), `not_fitted`, `insufficient_slots` (+`{used, cost, limit}` context),
  `unavailable` fallback, and the `idempotent_replay` marker on replays.
- **ACL (0109:265–273 verbatim posture):** private command + shared mapper revoked from
  public/anon/authenticated + granted to service_role; both wrappers revoked from public/anon +
  granted to authenticated (dark: every layer's gate rejects today).

**Doc-sync (same step).** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`: §1 gained the `module_fitting_receipts` row
(**Fitting**; sole writer = `fitting_execute_command` via the two wrappers; one-command-for-both-
actions rationale; DARK, no row can exist today) and the `ship_module_fittings` row's "called by
NOTHING yet" became "called today ONLY by Fitting's own command `fitting_execute_command` (0113)";
the §2 Fitting row now records the full command layer (wrappers → private command → `fitting_apply`),
the home-only rule with its rationale and the as-shipped ⚠ note, the new DOWNWARD reads
(Reference/Config flag · Main Ship `spatial_state`), and the expanded forbidden column (no second
receipt writer, no client exposure of command/writer/mapper, no fit/unfit while the gate is off).
Still nothing depends on Fitting.

**State.** `npm run build` green (no `src/` change was made — confirmed). Migration head **0113**;
`module_fitting_enabled='false'` — the entire command surface is server-rejected at every layer
(both wrappers gate, the private command gates first, the writer stays service_role-only); no flag
flipped, no live DB write, no workflow touched. **DB-apply posture (honest, unchanged from
P11–P13):** no psql/docker/supabase CLI in this sandbox — the migration was hand-verified
line-by-line against 0109 (order, replay, receipts, ACL), 0112 (delegation contract), and
0054/0055 (state values); live assertions run in the owner's environment and will be covered by
the later `verify:fitting` dark-posture script. PR-ready on `autopilot/20260703-064048`, `main`
untouched. Next: the adapter slice (modules feeding `calculate_expedition_stats` under the slot
cap) and/or the read surface, then frontend + `verify:fitting`.

## 2026-07-04 — FITTING-P14 SLICE B — `ship_module_fittings` + the single Fitting writer `0112` (`fitting_apply`; FIT and UNFIT through THE ONE writer)

**Request.** Implement slice B of Phase 14: ONE new forward-only migration with the fitting-state
table and THE ONE Fitting writer. NO RPC wrapper, NO receipts table, NO adapter change, NO
frontend, NO verify script this slice. Idioms matched by re-reading the shipped sources first:
`0108` (module_instances schema + mint writer — the slice this one mirrors), `0109` (the
per-player advisory-lock key derivation), `0043` (main-ship ownership shape + `module_slots`).

**Work done — NEW `supabase/migrations/20260618000112_fitting_p14_fittings_schema.sql`**
(migration head moves **0111 → 0112**; `0001–0111` unedited):
- **`ship_module_fittings`** — Fitting-owned junction state:
  **`module_instance_id uuid PRIMARY KEY`** FK → `module_instances` on delete cascade (**the PK IS
  the invariant**: one module instance is fitted to at most one ship, ever — a schema fact, not
  writer discipline), `main_ship_id` FK → `main_ship_instances` on delete cascade, `player_id` FK →
  `auth.users` on delete cascade, `fitted_at timestamptz`, plus a `(main_ship_id)` index (the
  capacity sum + the future adapter read). RLS posture = 0108 verbatim: own-row SELECT only
  (`player_id = auth.uid()`), select granted to authenticated, NO write policy/grant — no client
  write path exists.
- **`fitting_apply(p_player uuid, p_module_instance_id uuid, p_main_ship_id uuid) returns jsonb`**
  — THE sole writer of `ship_module_fittings` (SECURITY DEFINER; service_role-only via the 0108
  relock idiom). **DECISION — fit/unfit in ONE writer:** `p_main_ship_id` NOT NULL = FIT, NULL =
  UNFIT; one sole writer per table covers ALL mutations of that table (insert AND delete) — two
  writer functions would be two writers. The writer enforces the STRUCTURAL invariants itself so no
  future caller can violate them, in order: (1) per-player
  `pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext('module_fitting'), hashtext(player))` FIRST (the exact 0109
  key-derivation idiom — serializes all of a player's fitting mutations; since every fitting on a
  ship belongs to the ship's owner, per-player IS per-ship-fit-set, so the capacity read cannot be
  raced); (2) module instance exists AND `module_instances.player_id = p_player`
  (`module_not_owned` — another player's instance answers like a nonexistent one); on FIT: (3) ship
  exists AND owned (`ship_not_owned`; also fixes owner-consistency — row.player = module owner =
  ship owner); (4) `already_fitted` reject NAMING the current ship — an already-fitted module is
  never silently re-homed (explicit unfit first; the PK backstops); (5) the CAPACITY HARD CAP —
  Σ `module_types.slot_cost` currently fitted to the ship + the new module's `slot_cost` ≤
  `main_ship_instances.module_slots`, else `insufficient_slots` + `{used, cost, limit}` — a hard
  rejection mirroring 0044:112–115, NEVER a clamp; (6) the one insert. UNFIT of a non-fitted
  module → distinct `not_fitted` (idempotency ENVELOPES are the slice-C command's receipt-replay
  job, not the writer's). Envelopes are the 0104/0109 private-writer family (`{ok, reason, …}` —
  the slice-C wrapper maps reasons to client codes); validation failures write nothing.
  **GAME-RULE checks deliberately live in the slice-C command layer, NOT here:** the
  `module_fitting_enabled` dark gate, the ship-must-be-home spatial rule, and receipt-keyed
  idempotency — this writer owns only table invariants and is unreachable by clients
  (service_role-only) until that gated command exists, so the feature stays fully dark.
- **ACL (0108:108–113 relock idiom verbatim):** execute revoked from public/anon/authenticated,
  granted to service_role only. No existing grant touched.

**Doc-sync (same step).** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`: §1 gained the `ship_module_fittings` row
(**Fitting**, owner; sole writer = `fitting_apply`, service_role-only, FIT+UNFIT through the one
writer, called by nothing yet); §2 gained the new **Fitting** leaf-system row (owns
`ship_module_fittings`; the full writer semantics; edges all DOWNWARD — Fitting → Modules (read
`module_instances`) · Main Ship (read ownership + `module_slots`) · Reference/Config (read
`module_types.slot_cost`); no system depends on Fitting yet — the Phase-14 adapter slice will later
add the Expedition-stats → Fitting downward READ edge; forbidden column bans a second mutation
path, clamping, silent re-homing, client exposure, and gating game rules in the writer).

**State.** `npm run build` green (no `src/` change was made — confirmed). Migration head **0112**;
`module_fitting_enabled='false'` — still fully dark: the ONE writer is service_role-only with ZERO
callers (dead-until-slice-C by design, documented as such), the table has no client write path, and
no flag was flipped, no live DB write, no workflow touched. **DB-apply posture (honest, unchanged
from P11–P13):** no psql/docker/supabase CLI in this sandbox — the migration was hand-verified
line-by-line against the shipped idioms it copies (0108 table+RLS+ACL posture, 0109 advisory-lock
key derivation, 0043 ownership reads, 0044 hard-cap semantics); live assertions run in the owner's
environment and will be covered by the later `verify:fitting` dark-posture script. PR-ready on
`autopilot/20260703-064048`, `main` untouched. Next: slice C (the dark two-layer fit/unfit command
— `module_fitting_enabled` gate, player-scoped receipts, ship-must-be-home rule, delegating to this
writer).

## 2026-07-04 — FITTING-P14 SLICE A — locked design decisions + dark flag/stats-catalog migration `0111` (`module_fitting_enabled` + `module_types.slot_cost`/`stats_json`)

**Request.** Begin Phase 14 "Module fitting" (ROADMAP `:89` — "`fit_module_to_ship` |
server-validated; feeds stats") with slice A: record the planner-approved LOCKED design decisions,
then ONE new forward-only migration seeding the dark flag + the module stats/slot-cost catalog
wiring. NO fittings table, NO RPC, NO adapter change, NO frontend, NO verify script this slice.
Recon: `FITTING_P14_RECON.local.md` (scope locked 2026-07-04). Template: the 0107 slice-A idiom.

**LOCKED DESIGN DECISIONS (planner-approved 2026-07-04):**
1. **SYSTEM SHAPE** — Phase 14 creates a NEW leaf system **Fitting** per ROADMAP law 5
   ("Fitting=modules"); fitting state will live in a NEW Fitting-owned junction table
   `ship_module_fittings` (arrives slice B — NOT this slice) with its own sole writer, never a
   second writer or new columns on `module_instances`; Fitting depends one-directionally DOWNWARD
   on Modules (read instances), Main Ship (read `module_slots`), and Reference/Config.
2. **CAPACITY/TRADEOFF MODEL** — mirrors the proven support-craft mechanism in 0044: each module
   type has an integer `slot_cost ≥ 1`; the adapter (extended in a later slice via
   `create or replace` in a new migration) will hard-REJECT when Σ slot_cost of fitted modules >
   `main_ship_instances.module_slots` (exception, never a clamp — the 0044:112–115 idiom), and
   slot_type-based tradeoff rules (pirate_attention / speed penalty) will apply exactly like
   0044's role-based rules — so module power is capacity-limited with tradeoffs, never a raw sum.
3. **STATS ENCODING** — reuse the `support_craft_types.base_stats_json` idiom: add a
   `stats_json jsonb not null default '{}'` column to `module_types`, using the SAME physical stat
   keys the adapter already reads (attack/defense/repair/cargo/scan/mining/evasion) plus one new
   key `speed_mult_bonus` (numeric fraction of hull base speed, applied before penalties — the
   engine archetype's positive effect; the adapter clamps total speed exactly as today:
   `round(greatest(0.2, …), 3)` — 0044:117–118).
4. **FLAG** — `module_fitting_enabled` seeded `'false'`, the exact 0097/0102/0107 idiom; every
   Phase 14 RPC must check it FIRST and reject-before-any-read; this migration flips nothing.

**Work done — NEW `supabase/migrations/20260618000111_fitting_p14_config_and_stats.sql`**
(migration head moves **0110 → 0111**; `0001–0110` unedited):
- **(a)** `game_config` seed `module_fitting_enabled='false'` (`on conflict (key) do nothing`, the
  exact 0097/0102/0107 dark-gate idiom + description stating the reject-before-any-read law).
- **(b)** `alter table module_types add column slot_cost integer not null default 1 check
  (slot_cost >= 1), add column stats_json jsonb not null default '{}'::jsonb` — Reference/Config
  CATALOG data exactly like `support_craft_types.capacity_cost`/`base_stats_json` (0042). Posture
  unchanged: the existing 0107 public-read policy + grants cover new columns (the 0075/0076
  add-column precedent); still no client write path; no function created → no execute relock
  (0054 precedent). First code consumer arrives with the Phase 14 adapter slice — nothing reads
  them today.
- **(c)** Write-once per-id UPDATEs seeding the four shipped archetypes, guarded on
  `stats_json = '{}'::jsonb` (the update analogue of the seeds' `on conflict do nothing` — a
  re-run or later owner rebalance is never clobbered). Magnitudes were read against the 0042
  `base_stats_json` band (missile_boat cap 3 → attack 12 · cargo_drone cap 2 → cargo 20 ·
  survey_drone cap 2 → scan 8 · decoy_drone cap 1 → evasion 6) so a full 3-slot fit is comparable
  to a similarly-sized support loadout: `autocannon_battery` (weapon) slot 1 → `{"attack":10}` ·
  `vector_thruster_kit` (engine) slot 1 → `{"evasion":3,"speed_mult_bonus":0.1}` ·
  `expanded_cargo_lattice` (cargo) **slot 2** (deliberately multi-slot so the Σ slot_cost cap math
  is exercised) → `{"cargo":25}` · `deep_scan_sensor_array` (sensor) slot 1 → `{"scan":8}`.

**Doc-sync (same step).** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`: the §1 `module_types` row now records
`slot_cost` + `stats_json` (still migration-seeded only, NO runtime writer; consumer = the Phase 14
fitting adapter, later slice). Deliberately NO Fitting system row yet — `ship_module_fittings`
does not exist until slice B, and a doc must never describe state that isn't real.

**State.** `npm run build` green (no `src/` change was made — confirmed). Migration head **0111**;
`module_fitting_enabled='false'` and `module_crafting_enabled='false'` — nothing client-writable
was added (one dark flag + two inert catalog columns + write-once seeds; no RPC, no writer, no
reader). No flag flipped, no live DB write, no workflow touched. **DB-apply posture (honest,
unchanged from P11–P13):** no psql/docker/supabase CLI in this sandbox — the migration was
hand-verified line-by-line against the idioms it copies (0107 flag seed, 0042 catalog stats shape,
0075/0076 add-column posture); live assertions run in the owner's environment and will be covered
by the later `verify:fitting` dark-posture script. PR-ready on `autopilot/20260703-064048`,
`main` untouched. Next: slice B (`ship_module_fittings` + the Fitting sole writer).

---

## 2026-07-04 — MODULES-P13 SLICE F (final) — `verify:modules` dark-posture script. **Phase 13 Module crafting — dark implementation complete (slices A–F)**

**Request.** Implement slice F, the last Phase 13 slice: the dark-posture verify script + its
`package.json` entry, mirroring the exploration/mining verifier twins (read end-to-end first:
`verify-exploration.mjs`, `verify-mining.mjs`, `scripts/lib/verify-harness.mjs`,
`scripts/lib/verifier-teardown.mjs`). Touches ONLY `scripts/verify-modules.mjs`, `package.json`,
this file, and the recon scratch file. No migrations (head stays **0110**), no CI/workflow edits,
no flags.

**Flag-handling mechanism — the twins', stated and followed exactly.** `verify-mining.mjs:16–20`
records the mechanism verbatim: the twins **NEVER write `game_config` and NEVER flip their flag**
— they exercise NO lit path at all (the `set_game_config` flip in `verify-mainship-send.mjs` is
the explicitly-NOT-copied alternative; the self-rolling-back mechanism exists only in the
separate `trade-economy-bootstrap-proof` psql/CI harness, which is workflow-wired and out of this
loop's scope). So `verify-modules.mjs` proves the DARK contracts only, and the requested lit-path
behaviors are recorded in the HUMAN ACTIVATION CHECKLIST below — run on a DEV database by the
owner, never by this script. Teardown guarantee: the shared `teardownVerifier` deletes the
throwaway user (the 0108/0109 player FKs cascade any of its rows away); no flag entry is passed
because the script touches NO flag — nothing to restore, `module_crafting_enabled` stays exactly
as found (`'false'`).

**Work done:**
- **NEW `scripts/verify-modules.mjs`** — imports the shared harness from day one
  (`Abort`/`createReporter`/`createUserFactory`/`resolveEnv` from `scripts/lib/verify-harness.mjs`
  + `teardownVerifier` from `scripts/lib/verifier-teardown.mjs`) — ZERO inline harness copies (the
  harness header's law). Same posture as the twins: dark contracts only; NEVER writes
  `game_config`; service key OPTIONAL (teardown only); one throwaway signup. Asserts, in the
  twins' order/idioms:
  (1) **dark rejection** — `craft_module` → `{ok:false, code:'feature_disabled'}` (0109 gates
  before any validation — anti-probe) and `get_my_module_instances` →
  `{ok:false, reason:'module_crafting_disabled'}` (0110), both authenticated;
  (2) **catalog seeds (0107, exact contract)** — `module_types` = the 4 seeded archetypes with
  their slot types; `module_recipe_ingredients` = exactly 12 rows, all `qty > 0`, per-type
  ingredient maps equal to the seed verbatim, and every ingredient id present in `item_types`
  (the client-checkable form of FK validity). NOTE the deliberate inversion vs mining's
  "no field leak": these catalogs are PUBLIC-READ by design (the item_types posture), so reading
  them back exactly IS the posture assertion;
  (3) **player-state RLS + no client write path** — `module_instances` + `module_craft_receipts`
  own-row RLS (fresh user sees 0 rows) AND inserts denied to the authenticated client on all four
  Modules/Production tables (both state tables + both catalogs);
  (4) **internal surfaces locked** — `production_craft_module` + `modules_mint_instance` denied
  to the authenticated client; both public RPCs denied to anon;
  (5) **config presence (read-only)** — `module_crafting_enabled` = false, via the same
  jsonb-storage-tolerant comparison.
- **`package.json`** — `"verify:modules": "node scripts/verify-modules.mjs"` added in the verify
  cluster, directly after `verify:mining`, same command shape.
- **CI note:** grep confirms the exploration/mining verifiers are wired into NO workflow file —
  there is nothing to mirror, and no workflow was created or modified (dispatching/enabling
  workflows is outside this loop). Wiring `verify:modules` into CI, if desired, is a human /
  PR-review step.
- **Verify posture run honestly:** `node --check scripts/verify-modules.mjs` parses clean;
  `npm run build` green. `node scripts/verify-modules.mjs` in this sandbox aborts at the
  throwaway SIGNUP step with the environmental TLS failure ("signup failed: fetch failed") —
  `node scripts/verify-mining.mjs` aborts at the IDENTICAL point in the same run, so this is the
  known environmental-fail-only posture (the Phase 12 slice-G precedent), and reaching that
  identical abort point proves the harness wiring. The assertions themselves run against a real
  DB in the owner's environment.
- `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` needs NO change this slice (checked the twins' verify slices: the
  Phase 12 slice-G entry recorded the same) — no table, writer, or cross-system edge (a read-only
  verifier script + one npm alias).

---

### Phase 13 Module crafting — dark implementation complete (slices A–F) — closing summary

- **Migrations `0107–0110`** (head **0106 → 0110**; all forward-only; `0001–0106` never edited):
  `0107` config/flag + catalogs (`module_crafting_enabled='false'` + `module_types` +
  `module_recipe_ingredients` + 4 seeded archetypes whose recipes reuse EXISTING `item_types`
  rows) · `0108` instances schema + the ONE mint writer (`module_instances` with the
  `mint_key` idempotency spine + `modules_mint_instance`, service_role-only) · `0109` the craft
  command (`module_craft_receipts` + `craft_module` wrapper → private `production_craft_module`;
  dark-gate-first, per-player advisory lock, trade-semantics verbatim replay, items-only cost via
  `inventory_spend`, one craft = one instance via the namespaced `craft:` mint key) · `0110` the
  read surface (`get_my_module_instances`; the 0101/0106 idiom; no catalog RPC — public-read
  catalogs are direct client selects).
- **Frontend:** dark `src/features/modules/` (types/api/panel — the twins' structure; server-driven
  visibility, fails closed to null; MarketPanel per-row claims; direct catalog + own-inventory
  selects) wired beside `MiningPanel` in `GalaxyMapScreen.tsx`.
- **Verify:** `scripts/verify-modules.mjs` + `npm run verify:modules` (dark posture only, shared
  harness, never flips flags).
- **Design decisions (owner-directed, slice A):** Modules leaf system + Production-owned craft
  command; instant idempotent craft (player-scoped receipts; `build_orders` integration deferred
  with the mint-helper retirement note); normalized items-only recipes; one craft = one instance;
  `module_crafting_enabled` flag.
- **Ownership/laws:** SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES §1 rows (`module_types`/`module_recipe_ingredients`,
  `module_instances`, `module_craft_receipts`) + §2 Modules and Production rows — every doc synced
  in the SAME step as its fact; edges all DOWNWARD/acyclic (Production → Inventory · Modules ·
  Reference/Config); sole writers: catalogs none (migration-seeded), `module_instances` =
  `modules_mint_instance` (called only by 0109), `module_craft_receipts` =
  `production_craft_module`.
- **HUMAN ACTIVATION CHECKLIST (the owner's gate — never this loop):** (1) apply migrations
  0107–0110 to the target DB; (2) run `npm run verify:modules` there — expect ALL dark-posture
  checks green; (3) optionally flip `module_crafting_enabled='true'` on a DEV database and run the
  lit path there: seed a test player's inventory (e.g. via secured mining/exploration deposits or
  a dev grant), then `craft_module` with sufficient balances → expect success AND (a) exactly the
  recipe quantities spent from `player_inventory` with matching negative `inventory_ledger` rows,
  (b) exactly ONE `module_instances` row minted with the namespaced `craft:<player>:<request_id>`
  key, (c) exactly one `module_craft_receipts` row; REPLAY the same (player, request_id) → same
  `instance_id` + `idempotent_replay:true`, and provably NO double-spend/double-mint; a shortfall
  craft → `insufficient_items` with `{item_id, have, need}`, nothing spent, no receipt;
  `unknown_module` and `no_recipe` codes fire; `modules_mint_instance` twice with the same key
  (service_role) → one row; `get_my_module_instances` returns the crafted instance newest-first
  for the owner and NOT for a second test player; then flip the flag back and decide production
  activation separately. The loop ships everything server-rejected; activation is exclusively the
  human's.

**State.** `npm run build` green; `node --check` clean on the new script. Migration head **0110**;
`module_crafting_enabled='false'` everywhere; no flag flipped, no live DB write, no workflow
touched. **Phase 13 Module crafting is implemented DARK end-to-end and PR-ready on
`autopilot/20260703-064048`** — SAFE FOR HUMAN MERGE REVIEW; `main` untouched.

---

## 2026-07-04 — MODULES-P13 SLICE E — dark frontend `src/features/modules/` (catalog + craft + instances panel; renders nothing while the server says dark). Frontend only — no migration

**Request.** Implement slice E: the dark module-crafting frontend mirroring the post-cleanup
exploration/mining twins exactly (read end-to-end first: both panels + api/types modules, the
shared `src/lib/useActivityPanelGuards.ts`, the GalaxyMapScreen mounting, MarketPanel's per-row
state shapes, and the `mainshipApi.ts` direct-select convention). NO migration (head stays
**0110**), NO verify script, no config.

**Work done — NEW `src/features/modules/` (the twins' structure, adapted where crafting differs):**
- **`modulesTypes.ts`** — pure types + copy (the miningTypes.ts idiom): `ModuleInstance` (the 0110
  row), `GetMyModuleInstancesResult`, `CraftModuleResult` (0109 wrapper shape; `item_id`/`have`/
  `need` are REAL server data on the `insufficient_items` code), the public catalog row types, and
  the craft error-copy map (`module_crafting_disabled` read reason is handled by the fail-closed
  render, not copy; command codes covered: `feature_disabled`, `invalid_request`,
  `unknown_module`, `no_recipe`, `insufficient_items`, `not_authenticated`, `unavailable`) +
  `craftModuleErrorMessage`.
- **`modulesApi.ts`** — thin `supabase.rpc` wrappers for `craft_module` +
  `get_my_module_instances` (identical envelope-handling idiom: transport error → normalized
  failure, never a throw into the render path), PLUS two direct selects per the shipped
  conventions: `fetchModuleCatalog()` reads the PUBLIC-READ `module_types` +
  `module_recipe_ingredients` (0107) by direct table select — the `mainshipApi.ts` hull-types
  convention; deliberately NO catalog RPC exists (0110 header) — and `fetchMyItemBalances()` reads
  the caller's own `player_inventory` rows through the EXISTING 0039 own-row grant (the existing
  Inventory read path; no new server surface, no new cross-system edge).
- **`ModulesPanel.tsx`** — server-driven visibility: reads the instances on mount/lifecycle change
  and **fails closed to null on ANY non-ok envelope** — the Exploration/Mining twins' posture via
  `isServerLit` (the hook documents this server-lit stance as distinct from MarketPanel's
  shell-with-`unavailableNote`, which is reserved for client-flag-mounted shells — the twins ARE
  the match here; while the server returns `module_crafting_disabled` the panel renders nothing,
  so production is unchanged; the panel never pretends the feature is on). Catalog + balances are
  fetched only after the server lights the surface. **Per-module-type claim keys**
  (`tryClaim(entry.id)` — the MarketPanel per-row granularity, with its
  `pending`/`rowNote: Record<string, …>` state shapes) since the catalog lists multiple craftable
  types; fresh `crypto.randomUUID()` request id per submit (the twins' idiom; the server dedups on
  (player_id, request_id)); craft buttons disable while in flight and on a client-side shortfall
  preview (server stays authoritative — `insufficient_items`); ingredient lines show
  `item ×qty (have N)` with shortfalls flagged rose; the `insufficient_items` failure note appends
  the server's real `item_id: have/need` (the mining cooldown-suffix idiom); crafted-instances
  list (name, slot badge, timestamp), newest first. **Crafting is NON-SPATIAL** (player-scoped,
  0109) — no ship/settled precondition, so unlike the twins the panel takes only `lifecycleKey`
  (no ship props; a deliberate, documented deviation). Sky styling vs violet/amber; positioned
  bottom-left BESIDE MiningPanel (`left-[33.5rem]` — the w-64 row continues; all three activity
  panels are server-lit, so overlap only ever involves lit surfaces).
- **Wiring:** `GalaxyMapScreen.tsx` — `ModulesPanel` imported and rendered directly adjacent to
  `MiningPanel`, same container, same comment convention, same `lifecycleKey` expression.

**Doc-sync note.** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` needs NO change (the MINING-P12 SLICE F precedent,
stated explicitly per the request): frontend-only — no table, no writer, no cross-system edge;
the server contracts the new files mirror (0107/0109/0110, the 0039 grant) are unchanged.

**State.** `npm run build` green (tsc -b + vite, exit 0). `npm run lint`: the 4 touched files
(`modulesTypes.ts`, `modulesApi.ts`, `ModulesPanel.tsx`, `GalaxyMapScreen.tsx`) lint CLEAN
(targeted eslint exit 0, incl. exhaustive-deps via the stable-ref dep); full-repo lint still FAILS
with exactly the same 14 pre-existing out-of-scope errors recorded in MINING-CLEANUP SLICE 1
(`MainShipMarker.tsx`, `SpaceRouteLine.tsx`, `useSpaceMoveCommand.ts`, tests harnesses/spec —
no new problems). Migration head stays **0110** (no migrations, no flags); everything still dark
and server-rejected — the panel is wired but renders nothing while
`module_crafting_enabled='false'`. PR-ready on `autopilot/20260703-064048`, `main` untouched.
Next: slice F (`scripts/verify-modules.mjs` + the `verify:modules` entry).

---

## 2026-07-04 — MODULES-P13 SLICE D — the dark read surface `0110` (`get_my_module_instances()`). **Server side of Phase 13 complete, fully dark**

**Request.** Implement slice D: ONE new forward-only migration with the read surface, mirroring
the exploration/mining read surfaces (0101/0106) exactly — re-read end-to-end first. NO frontend,
NO verify script this slice.

**Work done — NEW `supabase/migrations/20260618000110_modules_p13_read_surface.sql`** (migration
head moves **0109 → 0110**; `0001–0109` unedited):
- **`get_my_module_instances()`** — the 0101/0106 body step-for-step (line-level sources:
  envelope + auth + dark-gate order **0101:36–44 / 0106:38–46**; jsonb_agg row shape + desc
  ordering + coalesce-to-`[]` **0101:49–63 / 0106:51–65**; `stable`/`security definer`/
  `set search_path = public` posture **0101:26–29**): `auth.uid()` → `not_authenticated`
  envelope; then the dark gate BEFORE any instance read — `{ok:false,
  reason:'module_crafting_disabled'}` (the 0101 `exploration_disabled` / 0106 `mining_disabled`
  envelope shape), identical regardless of caller state (no probing while dark); then the
  caller's OWN `module_instances` joined to their `module_types` catalog identity. Per row:
  `instance_id`, `module_type_id`, `name`, `slot_type`, `created_at` — newest first
  (`created_at desc`); response `{ok:true, instances:[…]}` mirroring
  `{ok:true, discoveries/extractions:[…]}`.
- **Catalog surface decision — the precedent points AGAINST a catalog RPC, and was followed:**
  0101/0106 exist because `exploration_sites`/`mining_fields` are HIDDEN (RLS, no client
  policy — reveal only through the player's own rows). The module catalog/recipe tables are the
  opposite posture by design (0107): public-read Reference/Config catalogs exactly like
  `item_types` (0039:23–25) / `support_craft_types` (0042:32–36) / `trade_goods`, which the
  client reads by DIRECT table select (the shipped convention — e.g. the hull-type selects in
  `src/features/map/mainshipApi.ts`). A `get_module_catalog` RPC would duplicate an
  already-public surface — NOT added.
- **No inventory-balance join:** no shipped read surface joins another system's balances
  (`inventory_get_balance` is an internal service_role-only leaf, 0039:156). The surface stays
  dumb; the client reads its own `player_inventory` through the existing Inventory read path
  (the 0039:50–52 own-row select policy + grant). No new cross-system read edge without
  precedent.
- **ACL verbatim from 0101:69–70 / 0106:71–72:** execute revoked from public/anon, granted to
  authenticated only — and dark today: the gate rejects every call while
  `module_crafting_enabled='false'`.

**Doc-sync (same step).** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`: the §2 Modules row gained
`get_my_module_instances()` with its dark-gate semantics + the two recorded non-additions (no
catalog RPC, no balance join, with the precedent reasons). The §1 matrix is UNCHANGED — mirroring
the 0101/0106 precedent exactly: read surfaces add no writer and are recorded in the §2 system
row, not the matrix (the mining slice-E entry did the same).

**State.** `npm run build` green. Migration head **0110**. **The server side of Phase 13 Module
crafting is COMPLETE (slices A–D) and fully dark end-to-end:** the craft command (both layers)
and the read surface all server-reject while `module_crafting_enabled='false'`; the mint writer
is service_role-only; the catalogs are inert public-read reference data. No flag flipped, no live
DB write, no workflow touched. **DB-apply posture (honest, unchanged from slices A–C):** no
psql/docker/supabase CLI in this sandbox and npx cannot fetch (`UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE`)
— the migration was hand-verified line-by-line against 0101/0106 at the sources cited above; live
assertions run in the owner's environment and will be covered by the slice-F `verify:modules`
dark-posture script. PR-ready on `autopilot/20260703-064048`, `main` untouched. Next: slice E
(dark frontend `src/features/modules/`, consuming `useActivityPanelGuards`), then slice F
(`verify:modules`).

## 2026-07-04 — MODULES-P13 SLICE C — the dark craft command `0109` (`module_craft_receipts` + `craft_module` → private `production_craft_module`)

**Request.** Implement slice C of Phase 13: ONE new forward-only migration with the player-scoped
craft-receipt ledger and the two-layer craft command. NO read surface, NO frontend this slice.
Idioms matched by re-reading the shipped sources end-to-end first: `0099` (scan command) + `0104`
(extract command) for the two-layer/envelope/ACL shape, `0089` (`market_buy`) + `0095`
(`market_claim_relief`) for the trade replay + insufficient-balance envelope, `0086`/`0094` for
the receipts-table RLS posture, `0078`/`0080` for the per-player advisory lock.

**Work done — NEW `supabase/migrations/20260618000109_modules_p13_craft_command.sql`**
(migration head moves **0108 → 0109**; `0001–0108` unedited):
- **`module_craft_receipts`** — Production-owned per-player idempotency ledger:
  `receipt_id uuid pk`, `player_id` (the 0108 `auth.users on delete cascade` FK shape),
  `request_id text not null`, `module_type_id` FK → `module_types`, `instance_id` FK →
  `module_instances` (`on delete cascade` — the instance only ever disappears via the auth.users
  cascade today; cascading the receipt keeps account deletion order-safe across the multi-path
  cascade graph, the 0088 child-FK lesson), `created_at`, **unique (player_id, request_id)**.
  RLS posture copied from the player-scoped receipts precedent `trade_relief_claims`
  (**0094:24–43**): owner-read select policy + `grant select to authenticated`, NO write
  policy/grant. No extra index — the unique index leads on player_id and covers idempotency
  probes + owner lookups (the 0086:53–55 comment idiom).
- **`craft_module(p_request_id text, p_module_type text)`** *(authenticated wrapper — the
  0099:221–300 wrapper idiom: auth check → anti-probe flag gate FIRST → delegate → reason→
  code/message map; the `insufficient_items` failure passes its `{item_id, have, need}` context
  through, the 0104 `retry_after_seconds` pass-through idiom)* → private
  **`production_craft_module(p_player, p_module_type, p_request_id)`** *(service_role)*:
  1. **Dark gate FIRST** (0107 law; **0099:108–113**): `module_crafting_enabled` false →
     `feature_disabled` before ANY other read.
  2. request_id validation — TEXT per the locked signature (the shipped receipt columns are uuid;
     text is validated non-empty + length-capped at 200 since it lacks uuid's intrinsic bound).
  3. **Per-player advisory lock BEFORE the replay check** —
     `pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext('module_craft'), hashtext(player))`, the shipped commission
     idiom (**0078:43/79**): the player-scoped analogue of market_buy's per-ship lock
     (0089:104–106) and relief's wallet FOR UPDATE (0095:53–57), both taken before their
     idempotency checks for the same race-safety reason (a same-request_id race resolves to one
     craft + one verbatim replay; the pre-check→spend window can't be raced by another craft of
     the same player).
  4. **REPLAY — matched to the TRADE receipts semantics (0089:108–116 / 0095:60–66), stated
     explicitly:** an existing (player, request_id) receipt returns the ORIGINAL success envelope
     rebuilt verbatim from the receipt row, flagged `idempotent_replay` — **NO payload-conflict
     check** (a same-key-different-module_type replay returns the original receipt's data, exactly
     as market_buy replays a same-key-different-good call). The `request_id_payload_conflict` hash
     check (0099:140–148) belongs to the ship-scoped space receipts, which this player-scoped
     command does not use.
  5. Catalog validation: `unknown_module` (bad id) vs **`no_recipe`** (catalog row with zero
     `module_recipe_ingredients` rows — a distinct truthful reason so a seed gap is diagnosable).
  6. **Ingredient pre-check** via `inventory_get_balance` — shortfall returns
     `{ok:false, reason:'insufficient_items', item_id, have, need}` (the **0089:150–153**
     `insufficient_credits` + context shape) WITHOUT spending anything.
  7. **One transaction:** loop the recipe rows → `inventory_spend(player, item, qty)` each (its
     exceptions — 0039:113–121 — roll back everything; a failed craft writes NO receipt, the
     0099/0104 law) → mint exactly ONE instance via
     `modules_mint_instance(player, module_type, 'craft:'||player||':'||request_id)` (the
     namespaced key per 0108's producer contract) → insert the receipt → success envelope with
     `instance_id`/`receipt_id`/`module_type_id`/`crafted_at`. Crafting never touches
     `player_inventory`/`inventory_ledger`/`module_instances` directly — only the two leaf
     functions. This is `inventory_spend`'s FIRST live caller.
- **ACL (0099:302–311 / 0104:291–299 verbatim):** private writer revoked from
  public/anon/authenticated + granted to service_role; wrapper revoked from public/anon + granted
  to authenticated (dark: both its gate and the writer's first check reject today).

**Doc-sync (same step).** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`: §1 gained the `module_craft_receipts` row
(**Production**, owner; sole writer = `production_craft_module` via the `craft_module` wrapper;
DARK) and the `module_instances` row's "NOTHING calls it yet" became "called today ONLY by
Production's craft command (0109)"; §2 Production row gained `module_craft_receipts` in its owns
column, the full `craft_module` semantics in its functions column (dark-gated, idempotent by
player+request_id with verbatim replay, items-only cost, downward `inventory_spend` +
`modules_mint_instance` fan-out, one craft = one instance), and the direct-write bans in its
forbidden column; §2 Modules row's "will belong to Production" note went present-tense
("SHIPPED as `craft_module` (0109)") and its "NOTHING calls it yet" was replaced by the caller
fact. New edges all DOWNWARD (Production → Inventory · Modules · Reference/Config) — acyclic, no
second writer anywhere.

**State.** `npm run build` green. Migration head **0109**; still fully dark — the wrapper and
writer both server-reject while `module_crafting_enabled='false'`; no flag flipped, no live DB
write, no workflow touched. **DB-apply posture (honest, unchanged from slices A/B):** no
psql/docker/supabase CLI in this sandbox and npx cannot fetch (`UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE`)
— the migration was hand-verified line-by-line against the named idiom sources above; live
assertions run in the owner's environment and will be covered by the slice-G `verify:modules`
dark-posture script. PR-ready on `autopilot/20260703-064048`, `main` untouched. Next: slice D
(the read surface, e.g. `get_my_module_instances()` — the 0101/0106 idiom).

---

## 2026-07-04 — MODULES-P13 SLICE B — `module_instances` schema + the single Modules mint writer `0108` (`modules_mint_instance`; idempotent by `mint_key`)

**Request.** Implement slice B of Phase 13: ONE new forward-only migration with the
`module_instances` table and the ONE Modules mint writer. NO craft command, NO receipts table, NO
read surface, NO frontend this slice. Idioms matched by re-reading the shipped sources first:
`0098` (exploration_discoveries) + `0103` (mining_extractions) for the player-state schema/RLS
posture, `0039` (Inventory) for the SECURITY DEFINER internal-writer + idempotency-key pattern,
and `0104:291–299` for the function-ACL relock wording.

**Work done — NEW `supabase/migrations/20260618000108_modules_p13_instances_schema.sql`**
(migration head moves **0107 → 0108**; `0001–0107` unedited):
- **`module_instances`** — `id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid()`;
  `player_id uuid not null references auth.users (id) on delete cascade` (the exact 0098/0103
  player-FK shape); `module_type_id text not null references module_types (id)`;
  **`mint_key text not null unique`** — the idempotency spine; `created_at timestamptz not null
  default now()`; plus the `(player_id, created_at desc)` player index (0098/0103 idiom).
  Instances are INDIVIDUAL rows, never counts (the Phase-13 law) — no quantity column by design.
  **NO fitting columns** (`fitted_ship_id`/slots/stats are Phase 14, forward-only).
- **RLS posture copied from the P11/P12 player-state tables exactly** (verified, not assumed —
  both 0098 `exploration_discoveries` and 0103 `mining_extractions` DO expose an owner-select
  policy): RLS enabled + `module_instances_select_own` (`player_id = auth.uid()`) +
  `grant select to authenticated`; NO insert/update/delete policy, NO write grant — no client
  write path exists.
- **`modules_mint_instance(p_player uuid, p_module_type text, p_key text) returns uuid`** — THE
  ONE writer of `module_instances`: plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER, `set search_path = public`;
  exception-style errors matching Inventory's internal-leaf idiom (`raise exception` on missing
  key / unknown module type — not a player envelope RPC); then
  `insert … on conflict (mint_key) do nothing`, and on conflict returns the EXISTING instance id
  for that key — true idempotent replay mirroring `inventory_deposit(p_key)`'s
  ledger-insert-is-the-guard semantics (0039:85–90): the same key can NEVER mint twice. Key
  namespacing is the producer's contract (the slice-C craft command derives keys from its own
  player-scoped receipts). Header states the **sole-writer law**: every future producer — the
  Phase-13 craft command AND any future `build_orders` queue completion (the recorded M4.5
  retirement path) — must mint through this function and nothing else.
- **ACL (0099/0104 relock idiom verbatim):** execute revoked from public/anon/authenticated,
  granted to service_role only. No existing grant touched.

**Doc-sync (same step).** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`: §1 gained the `module_instances` row
(**Modules**, owner-read; sole writer = `modules_mint_instance` (0108), idempotent by `mint_key`,
service_role-only, nothing calls it yet) and the catalog row dropped its now-stale "mint writer
arrives with `module_instances`" note; the §2 Modules row's function list gained the mint
signature + semantics (replacing "*none yet — no function exists*") — the
Production-will-own-the-craft-command note, the M4.5 retirement note, and the forbidden column
are unchanged and still accurate. No new cross-system edge: the helper reads only Modules' own
catalog (`module_types`), and nothing calls it yet — the graph stays acyclic.

**State.** `npm run build` green (tsc -b + vite, exit 0). Migration head **0108**;
`module_crafting_enabled='false'` — still fully dark: the mint writer is service_role-only with
ZERO callers (dead-until-slice-C by design, documented as such), the table has no client write
path, and no flag was flipped, no live DB write, no workflow touched. **DB-apply posture
(honest, unchanged from slice A):** no psql/docker/supabase CLI in this sandbox and npx cannot
fetch (`UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE`) — the migration was hand-verified line-by-line against
the shipped idioms it copies (0098/0103 table+RLS posture, 0039 writer/idempotency pattern,
0104 ACL block); live assertions run in the owner's environment and will be covered by the
slice-G `verify:modules` dark-posture script. PR-ready on `autopilot/20260703-064048`, `main`
untouched. Next: slice C (the craft command — Production system, player-scoped receipts,
`inventory_spend` fan-out + this mint helper).

---

## 2026-07-04 — MODULES-P13 SLICE A — locked design decisions + dark flag/catalog migration `0107` (`module_types` + `module_recipe_ingredients`)

**Request.** Begin Phase 13 "Module instances + crafting" (ROADMAP `:88` — "instances, not
stack-only") with slice A: record the owner's LOCKED design decisions, then ONE new forward-only
migration seeding the dark flag + the module catalog/recipe config tables + starter seeds. NO
instances table, NO command, NO read surface, NO frontend this slice. Recon:
`MODULES_P13_RECON.local.md` (scope locked 2026-07-04).

**LOCKED DESIGN DECISIONS (owner-directed 2026-07-04 — not self-approved):**
1. **System shape** (ROADMAP law 5: "Production=support craft/crafting · Fitting=modules"): a NEW
   leaf system **Modules** owns the module state tables (`module_types` catalog,
   `module_recipe_ingredients` config, and — in later slices — `module_instances` + a mint
   writer), while the craft COMMAND itself will belong to the existing **Production** system,
   depending DOWNWARD on Inventory (`inventory_spend`) and Modules (mint) — acyclic, one
   sole-writer per table.
2. **Crafting is INSTANT in Phase 13**: an idempotent dark command in the 0099/0104 two-layer
   idiom with a PLAYER-scoped receipts table (crafting is non-spatial, so
   `trade_relief_claims`-style (player, request_id) keying, NOT ship-scoped space receipts). The
   M4.5 "same queue" note is FUTURE meaning — integrating with `build_orders` would touch the
   shipped Production queue and risk the green M4.5 tests, so it is explicitly deferred with this
   RETIREMENT NOTE: when module production later moves onto the serial queue, the queued
   completion path must call the SAME Modules mint helper this phase creates.
3. **Recipe encoding is a normalized table, NOT jsonb**: `module_recipe_ingredients
   (module_type_id, item_id, qty)` with FKs to `module_types` and `item_types` and a `qty > 0`
   check — referential integrity over blob parsing; one implicit recipe per module type (its
   ingredient rows); costs are ITEMS-ONLY in Phase 13 (no metal/credits — the pipeline law says
   crafting consumes INVENTORY; metal would drag in a Base edge the phase doesn't need and can be
   added forward-only later).
4. **One craft = one instance** (no batching), keeping idempotency trivial.
5. **Flag name `module_crafting_enabled`**, seeded `'false'`, following the exact 0097/0102
   config+flag idiom including the server-side `feature_disabled` rejection posture for every
   future RPC.

**Work done — NEW `supabase/migrations/20260618000107_modules_p13_catalog_and_flag.sql`**
(migration head moves **0106 → 0107**; `0001–0106` unedited):
- **(a)** `game_config` seed `module_crafting_enabled='false'` (`on conflict (key) do nothing`,
  the exact 0097/0102 dark-gate idiom + description stating the reject-before-any-read law).
- **(b)** **`module_types`** — minimal intrinsic catalog identity ONLY: `id text primary key`,
  `name text not null`, `slot_type text not null` (intrinsic archetype; display now, fitting
  validation in Phase 14; unconstrained text like `item_types.category`/`support_craft_types.role`
  — no code consumer yet), `description text not null`, `created_at`. **NO stats columns** —
  stats wiring is Phase 14's job, added forward-only there.
- **(c)** **`module_recipe_ingredients`** per decision 3: FKs to both catalogs,
  `qty integer not null check (qty > 0)`, PK `(module_type_id, item_id)`.
- **(d)** Seeds (`on conflict do nothing`): 4 starter module types spanning distinct slot
  archetypes, copy matching the 0042 catalog tone — `autocannon_battery` (weapon: weapon_parts ×4
  + pirate_alloy ×2 + scrap ×6), `vector_thruster_kit` (engine: engine_parts ×4 + crystal ×2 +
  scrap ×4), `expanded_cargo_lattice` (cargo: scrap ×10 + pirate_alloy ×3 + repair_parts ×2),
  `deep_scan_sensor_array` (sensor: scan_data ×5 + anomaly_shard ×2 + blueprint_fragment ×1).
  Recipes consume ONLY EXISTING `item_types` rows (0039/0097 seeds REUSED — `item_types` is NOT
  touched; the 0097 reuse law).
- **(e)** RLS/grants — verified against the sources, not assumed: both tables copy the
  Reference/Config catalog posture verbatim (`item_types` 0039:23–25 / `support_craft_types`
  0042:32–36): RLS enabled, ONE public-read select policy, `grant select to anon, authenticated`,
  NO write policy/grant. No function created → no execute-surface relock needed (0054 precedent).

**Doc-sync (same step).** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`: §1 matrix gained the row
`module_types`, `module_recipe_ingredients` → **Modules** (catalog/config — seeded by migration
only, NO runtime writer yet; the mint writer arrives with `module_instances` in a later Phase-13
slice; public read-only); §2 gained the **Modules** system row recording the dark gate, the
Production-will-own-the-craft-command note (with the downward Inventory+Modules fan-out, the
player-scoped receipt keying, one-craft-one-instance, and the M4.5 retirement note) and the
forbidden column (never write player_inventory/inventory_ledger/base_resources; never mint outside
the ONE mint helper; fitting/`module_slots` is Phase 14).

**State.** `npm run build` green (tsc -b + vite). Migration head **0107**;
`module_crafting_enabled='false'` — nothing client-writable exists (two public-read catalogs + one
dark flag; no RPC, no writer, no reader). No flag flipped, no live DB write, no workflow touched.
**DB-apply posture (honest):** this sandbox has no psql/docker/supabase CLI and npx cannot fetch
(the recorded `UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE` environmental posture) — the migration was
hand-verified line-by-line against the shipped idioms it copies (0039/0042 table+RLS posture,
0097/0102 seed idiom, 0098 same-step boundaries sync), exactly the P11/P12 slice-B/C verification
posture; the seeds/flag assertions run against a real DB in the owner's environment (and will be
covered by the slice-G `verify:modules` dark-posture script). PR-ready on
`autopilot/20260703-064048`, `main` untouched. Next: slice B (`module_instances` + the mint
helper).

---

## 2026-07-04 — MINING-CLEANUP SLICE 2 (final) — MarketPanel migrated onto `useActivityPanelGuards`. **Guard-hook extraction complete — no local copies remain**

**Request.** Final slice of the mining-milestone cleanup: migrate `MarketPanel.tsx` (the idiom's
original reference copy) onto the shared hook, byte-equivalent behavior, and close the doc trail.

**Work done — `src/features/map/MarketPanel.tsx` only:**
- Local mounted-guard block + per-row `inFlightRef` Set replaced by
  `const { activeRef, tryClaim, release } = useActivityPanelGuards()` — the per-row granularity
  maps directly onto the hook's Set-of-string keys (`tryClaim(goodId)` / `release(goodId)`).
- Submit handler: `!shipId` first, then `tryClaim(goodId)` early-return; the qty validation now
  sits AFTER the claim with `release(goodId)` before its early return. **Behavior-equivalent
  reordering (claim→validate→release vs check→validate→claim):** the whole sequence is
  synchronous with NO await in between, so a duplicate in-flight click still returns before any
  validation side effect, and an invalid qty still leaves no lasting claim. `finally` now calls
  `release(goodId)`; the `activeRef`-guarded pending reset is untouched.
- Idiom comments repointed: the guard scaffold's home is `src/lib/useActivityPanelGuards.ts`;
  MarketPanel is now a consumer like Exploration/Mining, not the reference copy.
- `refresh` deps: `[shipId]` → `[shipId, activeRef]` (the SLICE 1 exhaustive-deps posture; ref
  identity is stable so `refresh`'s identity is unchanged). NOT touched: `pending`/`qty`/`rowError`
  state shapes, `refresh()`'s Promise.all body, the `!selectedShip → null` check, the
  shell-with-`unavailableNote` posture (still NOT `isServerLit` — documented in the hook), error
  copy via `tradeReasonMessage`, render output.

**Extraction promised in the SLICE F note is COMPLETE:** all three activity panels
(Market/Exploration/Mining) consume `useActivityPanelGuards`; grep confirms no file under `src/`
declares a local `activeRef`/`inFlightRef` guard outside the hook itself.

**Doc-sync note.** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` needs NO change (frontend-only, SLICE F precedent).

**State.** `npm run build` green (tsc -b + vite). `npm run lint`: the 2 touched files lint clean;
full-repo lint still FAILS with exactly the same 14 pre-existing out-of-scope errors recorded in
SLICE 1 (no new problems). Migration head stays **0106** (no migrations, no flags); everything
still dark and server-rejected. Diff = exactly 2 files (MarketPanel.tsx, this file).

---

## 2026-07-04 — MINING-CLEANUP SLICE 1 — panel guard scaffold extracted to `src/lib/useActivityPanelGuards.ts`; Exploration + Mining migrated

**Request.** Extract the duplicated activity-panel guard pattern (the documented cross-panel
"MarketPanel idiom") into ONE shared hook and migrate the two twin panels, byte-equivalent
behavior. This is the sanctioned **"adopt-on-next-real-change"** the SLICE F entry recorded when
it deliberately did NOT extract the scaffold (third copy landed → the change is now real).

**Work done — NEW `src/lib/useActivityPanelGuards.ts`** (frontend-only; `src/lib/` is the
established shared home, concern-per-file):
- **`useActivityPanelGuards()`** → `{ activeRef, tryClaim, release }`. The mounted guard is the
  MarketPanel block verbatim (`useRef(true)` + one empty-deps effect; StrictMode re-arms). The
  in-flight guard is a `useRef<Set<string>>` with stable callbacks: `tryClaim(key)` claims
  synchronously BEFORE any await (false if already claimed — the same-tick double-submit killer),
  `release(key)` drops it in the caller's `finally`. A Set-of-string serves BOTH granularities —
  MarketPanel's per-row `good_id` keys and Exploration/Mining's fixed `'scan'`/`'extract'` key —
  so one hook covers all three panels with zero behavior change.
- **`isServerLit(result)`** — the shared form of the `!result || !result.ok` fail-closed check,
  ONLY for server-lit panels that render nothing until the server affirms (Exploration/Mining
  style); explicitly NOT for MarketPanel's shell-with-unavailable-note posture. Typed
  `result is Extract<T, { ok: true }>` so the discriminated-union narrowing the inline checks
  gave callers is preserved (`result.discoveries`/`result.extractions` stay type-safe).

**Migrated (behavior byte-equivalent):** `ExplorationPanel.tsx` + `MiningPanel.tsx` — the local
`activeRef` block and boolean `inFlightRef` replaced by the hook; guard ORDER preserved
(`!mainShipId` first, then `tryClaim`); `finally` now calls `release(...)`; fail-closed render
check now `if (!isServerLit(result)) return null` under the same FAIL CLOSED comments; the
"MarketPanel idiom" comments repointed to the shared hook. NOT touched: `refresh()`, effect deps,
`lifecycleKey`, state shapes, error/success copy (incl. the mining cooldown suffix), MarketPanel.

**Doc-sync note.** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` needs NO change (SLICE F precedent): frontend-only,
no table, no writer, no cross-system edge; server contracts unchanged.

**State.** `npm run build` green (tsc -b + vite). `npm run lint`: the 4 touched files lint clean
(0 problems, incl. exhaustive-deps via the stable-ref dep); full-repo lint FAILS with 14
pre-existing errors in out-of-scope files (`MainShipMarker.tsx`, `SpaceRouteLine.tsx`,
`useSpaceMoveCommand.ts`, `tests/` harnesses/spec) that predate this slice and sit outside the
locked scope — NOT fixed here (scope law), left for their own cleanup step. Migration head stays
**0106** (no migrations, no flags); everything still dark and server-rejected. Diff = exactly
4 files (new hook, two panels, this file). Next slice: migrate MarketPanel's per-row guards onto
the same hook and retire its local copy.

---

## 2026-07-04 — MINING-P12 SLICE G (final) — `verify:mining` dark-posture script. **Phase 12 Mining — dark implementation complete (slices A–G)**

**Request.** Implement slice G, the last Phase 12 slice: the dark-posture verify script + its
`package.json` entry, mirroring the exploration slice-H precedent (the post-cleanup,
harness-importing form). Touches ONLY `scripts/verify-mining.mjs`, `package.json`, this file, and
the recon scratch file. No migrations (head stays **0106**), no CI/workflow edits, no flags.

**Work done:**
- **NEW `scripts/verify-mining.mjs`** — imports the shared harness from day one
  (`Abort`/`createReporter`/`createUserFactory`/`resolveEnv` from `scripts/lib/verify-harness.mjs`
  + `teardownVerifier` from `scripts/lib/verifier-teardown.mjs`) — ZERO inline harness copies (the
  harness header's law). Same posture as `verify-exploration.mjs`: proves the DARK contracts only;
  NEVER writes `game_config`, NEVER flips `mining_enabled`; service key OPTIONAL (teardown only);
  one throwaway signup. Asserts, in the exploration script's order/idioms:
  (1) **dark rejection** — `command_mining_extract(ZERO, ZERO)` →
  `{ok:false, code:'feature_disabled'}` (0104 gates before ship resolution — anti-probe) and
  `get_my_mining_extractions()` → `{ok:false, reason:'mining_disabled'}` (0106), both
  authenticated; (2) **no field leak** — authenticated select on `mining_fields` → denied/0 rows
  (0103 posture) and `mining_extractions` → 0 rows for a fresh user (own-row RLS);
  (3) **internal surfaces locked** — `mining_extract` + `process_mining_securing` denied to the
  authenticated client, both public RPCs denied to anon (`osn_distance` deliberately NOT
  re-asserted — `verify:exploration` owns that slice's surface, no duplicate assertion);
  (4) **config presence (read-only)** — `mining_enabled` = false, `mining_extract_radius` = 750,
  `mining_extract_cooldown_seconds` = 300, via the same jsonb-storage-tolerant comparison.
- **`package.json`** — `"verify:mining": "node scripts/verify-mining.mjs"` added in the verify
  cluster, directly after `verify:exploration`. No CI/workflow edits.
- **Verify posture run honestly:** `node --check scripts/verify-mining.mjs` parses clean.
  `node scripts/verify-mining.mjs` in this sandbox aborts at the throwaway SIGNUP step with the
  environmental TLS failure (`UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE` → "signup failed: fetch failed") —
  `node scripts/verify-exploration.mjs` aborts at the IDENTICAL point in the same run, so this is
  the known environmental-fail-only posture (DEV_LOG 2026-07-03 precedent), and reaching that
  identical abort point proves the harness wiring. The assertions themselves run against a real
  DB in the owner's environment.
- `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` needs NO change this slice — no table, writer, or cross-system edge
  (a read-only verifier script + one npm alias).

### Phase 12 Mining — dark implementation complete (slices A–G) — closing summary

- **Migrations `0102–0106`** (head **0101 → 0106**; all forward-only; `0001–0101` never edited):
  `0102` config/flag (`mining_enabled='false'` + `mining_extract_radius='750'` +
  `mining_extract_cooldown_seconds='300'`; NO new item_types rows) · `0103` schema
  (`mining_fields` hidden/server-only + repeatable `mining_extractions` with own-row RLS +
  cooldown/player indexes; 5 seeded fields, items-only bundles from the existing
  `ore`/`crystal`/`artifact_core`) · `0104` the extract command (`command_mining_extract` wrapper →
  private `mining_extract`; dark-gate-first, S2 lock, receipts idempotency, `osn_distance` radius,
  per-(player, field) cooldown with `retry_after_seconds`) · `0105` the securing processor
  (`process_mining_securing` + pg_cron `process-mining-securing` @60s; flag-ignoring in-flight
  safety; deposits via `reward_grant('mining', extraction_id, …)` — the sole depositor — on safe
  settle) · `0106` the read surface (`get_my_mining_extractions`; reveal-after-extraction only).
- **Frontend:** dark `src/features/mining/` (types/api/panel twins of the post-cleanup exploration
  files; server-driven visibility, fails closed to null) wired beside `ExplorationPanel` in
  `GalaxyMapScreen.tsx`; **shared-lib extractions** `src/lib/rewardBundle.ts` (`PendingBundle`) +
  `src/lib/osnState.ts` (`isSettledInSpace`) with exploration repointed same-step (no second copy).
- **Verify:** `scripts/verify-mining.mjs` + `npm run verify:mining` (dark posture only, shared
  harness, never flips flags).
- **Design decisions** (recon §8, self-approved 2026-07-04): exploration-template OSN-native
  extract command; repeatable extraction + server-enforced cooldown (no unique pair); rewards land
  in item inventory ONLY via `reward_grant('mining', …)` reusing existing catalog rows (never
  `base_resources`; `trade_goods` `'ore'` untouched); hidden fields + reveal-after-extraction;
  forfeiture deferred (0100 posture); cooldown per-ship serialization accepted while multi-ship is
  dark (0105 header note).
- **Ownership/laws:** SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES §1/§2 rows + ARCHITECTURE §7-adjacent §14 processor row +
  ACTIVITIES/ROADMAP untouched where already accurate — every doc synced in the SAME step as its
  fact; edges all DOWNWARD/acyclic; sole writers: `mining_fields` none (Reference/Config),
  `mining_extractions` = Mining (0104 inserts · 0105 secures); `reward_grant` the only depositor.
- **HUMAN ACTIVATION CHECKLIST (the owner's gate — never this loop):** (1) apply migrations
  0102–0106 to the target DB; (2) run `npm run verify:mining` there — expect ALL dark-posture
  checks green; (3) optionally flip `mining_enabled='true'` on a DEV database and run the lit
  path (settle in space near a seeded field → `command_mining_extract` → pending row → repeat →
  `cooldown` with `retry_after_seconds` → dock/return home → `process_mining_securing` deposits
  ore/crystal/core items via `reward_grant('mining', …)` → `get_my_mining_extractions` shows
  Secured) — then decide production activation separately. The loop ships everything
  server-rejected; activation is exclusively the human's.

**State.** `npm run build` green; `node --check` clean on the new script. Migration head **0106**;
`mining_enabled='false'` everywhere; no flag flipped, no live DB write, no workflow touched.
**Phase 12 Mining is implemented DARK end-to-end and PR-ready on `autopilot/20260703-064048`** —
SAFE FOR HUMAN MERGE REVIEW; `main` untouched.

## 2026-07-04 — MINING-P12 SLICE F — dark frontend `src/features/mining/` + shared `src/lib/rewardBundle.ts`/`osnState.ts` extraction (exploration repointed same-step)

**Request.** Implement slice F of the Phase 12 plan (recon §9): the dark mining frontend mirroring
the post-cleanup exploration frontend exactly, with the HARD-RULE duplication check. No server
changes, no migrations, no config — migration head STAYS **0106**.

**Duplication check first (the hard rule) — TWO extractions, exploration repointed in this same step:**
- **NEW `src/lib/rewardBundle.ts`** — `PendingBundleItem` + `PendingBundle` (the 0040/0041 server
  bundle contract). Mining needed the identical types verbatim; the one copy moved out of
  `explorationTypes.ts` (which now imports it) and `miningTypes.ts` imports it from day one.
- **NEW `src/lib/osnState.ts`** — `isSettledInSpace()` (the 0055 settled-in-space predicate that
  drives the action button's enabled state; server stays authoritative). Same story: moved out of
  `explorationTypes.ts`; `ExplorationPanel.tsx` and `MiningPanel.tsx` both import it from here.
  `src/lib/` is the established shared home (catalog/location/time idiom, concern-per-file).
- **NOT extracted (below the bar, stated per the request):** the panel scaffold
  (mounted-guard `activeRef` + synchronous `inFlightRef` + `refresh` callback) is the documented
  cross-panel "MarketPanel idiom" already present in several panels — the exploration cleanup pass
  reviewed these exact files and did not extract it; a shared-hook refactor would touch MarketPanel
  and siblings, out of this slice's scope (adopt-on-next-real-change precedent). The API wrappers
  (2-line rpc calls with per-feature names/types), the per-feature error-copy maps (different
  strings), and the inline `toLocaleString()` one-liner are trivial per-feature glue.

**Work done — NEW `src/features/mining/` (the exploration twins, post-cleanup state — NO
speculative disabled-reason constant, exactly what the cleanup pass deleted from exploration):**
- **`miningTypes.ts`** — `MiningExtraction` (the 0106 row: field_name, space_x/space_y,
  extracted_at, secured_at, bundle), `GetMyMiningExtractionsResult`,
  `CommandMiningExtractResult` (0104 wrapper success shape; failure envelope includes optional
  `retry_after_seconds` — REAL server data on the `cooldown` code), and the extract error-copy
  map (the 0104 code set) + `miningExtractErrorMessage`.
- **`miningApi.ts`** — thin `supabase.rpc` wrappers for `command_mining_extract` +
  `get_my_mining_extractions`, identical envelope-handling idiom (transport error → normalized
  failure, never a throw into the render path).
- **`MiningPanel.tsx`** — the `ExplorationPanel` structure verbatim: server-driven visibility
  (reads the extractions on mount/lifecycle change and **fails closed to null on ANY non-ok
  envelope without inspecting reason** — the documented deliberate posture; while the server
  returns `mining_disabled` the panel renders nothing, so production is unchanged); extract
  enabled only when settled in space; fresh `crypto.randomUUID()` request id per submit with the
  synchronous in-flight guard; extraction history list (field name, Pending/Secured badge, bundle
  contents as `item ×qty`, coords + timestamp). Mining-specific glue: the cooldown failure note
  appends the server's `retry_after_seconds`; amber styling vs exploration's violet; positioned
  bottom-left BESIDE ExplorationPanel (`left-[17rem]`; both are server-lit so overlap only ever
  involves lit surfaces).
- **Wiring:** `GalaxyMapScreen.tsx` — `MiningPanel` imported and rendered directly adjacent to
  `ExplorationPanel`, same import style, same props (`lifecycleKey`/`mainShipId`/`shipStatus`/
  `shipSpatialState`), same comment convention.

**Doc-sync note.** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` needs NO change: the extractions are client-side
display types/predicates (no table, no writer, no cross-system edge); the server contracts they
mirror are unchanged.

**State.** `npm run build` green (`tsc -b` typecheck + vite; standalone `tsc --noEmit` also clean).
Migration head stays **0106**; everything still dark — the panel is wired but renders nothing
(every mining RPC server-rejects while `mining_enabled='false'`), and the repointed exploration
surface is behavior-identical. PR-ready on `autopilot/20260703-064048`, `main` untouched. Next:
slice G (`scripts/verify-mining.mjs` + the `verify:mining` entry).

---

## 2026-07-04 — MINING-P12 SLICE E — the dark read surface `0106` (`get_my_mining_extractions()`). **Server side of Phase 12 complete, fully dark**

**Request.** Implement slice E of the Phase 12 plan (recon §9): ONE new forward-only migration with
the read surface, mirroring the exploration read surface 0101 exactly (function shape, dark-gate
behavior, reveal semantics, envelope, ACL). No frontend, no config changes, no other functions.

**Work done — NEW `supabase/migrations/20260618000106_mining_p12_read_surface.sql`** (migration
head moves **0105 → 0106**; `0001–0105` unedited):
- **`get_my_mining_extractions()`** — the 0101 body step-for-step: `auth.uid()` resolution
  (`not_authenticated` envelope), then the dark gate BEFORE any extraction/field read —
  `{ok:false, reason:'mining_disabled'}` (the 0101 `exploration_disabled` envelope shape),
  identical regardless of caller state (no probing while dark) — then the caller's OWN
  `mining_extractions` joined to the hidden `mining_fields` rows. Per row it reveals exactly the
  0101 attribute classes: field `name` + `space_x`/`space_y` (as 0101 reveals sites), the
  extraction's lifecycle fields (`extracted_at` = the row's `created_at`, `secured_at`), and
  `bundle` = the row's `pending_bundle_json` snapshot — 0101 exposes the discovery's pending
  bundle, so mining mirrors it; the field's own `reward_bundle_json` is never exposed directly.
  Ordering (`created_at desc`), response shape (`{ok:true, extractions:[…]}` mirroring
  `{ok:true, discoveries:[…]}`), and posture (`stable`, `security definer`,
  `set search_path = public`) all verbatim from 0101. Repeatability nuance (header-documented):
  the history legitimately contains multiple rows per field — one per extraction — and
  extracted-then-disabled fields stay visible (the 0101 posture: the player's own history).
- **Reveal rule (header):** a field is revealed ONLY through the player's own extraction rows —
  no browse-all surface; the 0103 no-client-policy posture on `mining_fields` is untouched, so an
  un-extracted field stays unreachable by construction (identical anti-probe stance to
  exploration).
- **ACL verbatim from 0101:** execute revoked from public/anon, granted to authenticated only —
  and dark today: the gate rejects every call while `mining_enabled='false'`.

**Doc-sync (same step).** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`: the §2 Mining row dropped its last
FORTHCOMING — the read surface is now named LIVE (read-only, dark-gated `mining_disabled`, the
only client path to field data, strictly post-extraction). The §1 matrix rows need NO change —
slice E adds no writer (`get_my_mining_extractions` is read-only; `mining_fields` still has no
runtime writer, `mining_extractions` still has exactly the two 0104/0105 writer fns).

**State.** `npm run build` green. Migration head **0106**. **The server side of Phase 12 Mining is
COMPLETE (slices A–E) and fully dark end-to-end:** the command wrapper + writer and the read
surface all server-reject while `mining_enabled='false'`; the securing processor correctly ignores
the flag but is inert (no extraction row can exist). No flag flipped, no live DB write; PR-ready on
`autopilot/20260703-064048`, `main` untouched. Next: slice F (dark frontend
`src/features/mining/`), then slice G (`verify:mining`).

---

## 2026-07-04 — MINING-P12 SLICE D — the securing processor `0105` (`process_mining_securing` + pg_cron; deposits via `reward_grant('mining', …)`)

**Request.** Implement slice D of the Phase 12 plan (recon §9): ONE new forward-only migration with
Mining's own securing processor, mirroring the exploration securing processor 0100 exactly —
mining's as-built extraction rows already model the lifecycle the same way (`secured_at` NULL =
pending, 0103), so the processor shape carries over verbatim with no structural deviation. No read
surface, no frontend, no config changes.

**Work done — NEW `supabase/migrations/20260618000105_mining_p12_securing_processor.sql`**
(migration head moves **0104 → 0105**; `0001–0104` unedited):
- **`process_mining_securing()`** — the 0100 body step-for-step: `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` sweep of
  `mining_extractions where secured_at is null`; carrying ship = the row's `main_ship_id`, else
  the player's canonical main ship via `mainship_resolve_owned_ship` (the 0100 NULL-fallback
  verbatim; unresolvable → the row waits); settled SAFE = `spatial_state in ('home','at_location')`
  per the 0055 state model (anything else waits); deposit target = the player's active home base
  (0050 idiom; null base → the row waits — guard kept verbatim from 0100 even though mining
  bundles are items-only, one pattern not two); then
  `reward_grant('mining', extraction_id, player, base, pending_bundle_json)` + `secured_at = now()`
  in the same transaction. Like 0100 there is NO per-row exception wrapper — skips are `continue`
  branches, and idempotency is DOUBLE-guarded (`secured_at` NULL filter + the `reward_grants`
  UNIQUE (source_type, source_id) law), so a re-run can never double-deposit.
- **Flag posture (0100 wording convention):** the processor deliberately IGNORES `mining_enabled`
  — in-flight safety: accrued pending value must never be stranded by an emergency flag-off.
  Naturally inert today: the 0104 writer rejects while the flag is false, so no extraction rows
  can exist and the processor sweeps an empty set.
- **Slice-C review note recorded in the header:** the 0104 cooldown is serialized per SHIP via the
  S2 lock, not per player — acceptable because the canonical model is one main ship per player
  (multi-ship stays DARK behind `mainship_additional_commission_enabled=false`) and no
  double-deposit is possible regardless (receipts + the `reward_grants` unique key); revisit if
  multi-main-ship ever activates.
- **ACL + cron verbatim from 0100:** execute revoked from public/anon/authenticated, granted to
  service_role; `create extension if not exists pg_cron`; idempotent unschedule guard
  (`undefined_table` swallowed); `cron.schedule('process-mining-securing', '* * * * *', …)` —
  every 60s (pg_cron's seconds form caps at 59s, so every-minute standard cron, the 0100 comment).
- NO forfeiture: a pending extraction simply WAITS (destroyed ships secure after recovery lands
  them home) — the 0100 posture, recon decision 4.

**Doc-sync (same step).**
- `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`: the `mining_extractions` §1 row now reads "ONE owner system, two
  writer fns: `mining_extract` (0104) inserts · `process_mining_securing` (0105) sets
  `secured_at`" (both LIVE); the §2 Mining row's securing paragraph rewritten to present tense
  (0105 shipped — safe-settle definition, double-guarded idempotency, flag-ignoring in-flight
  safety) with only the slice-E read surface still FORTHCOMING; the Mining → Bases (deposit-target
  read) and Mining → Reward (grant) edges are now live and the edge list stays all-DOWNWARD,
  exactly the Exploration shape.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §14 processors table: added the `process_mining_securing()` row exactly
  parallel to the exploration row (every 60s; deposits via `reward_grant('mining',
  extraction_id, …)` once the ship settles safe; deliberately ignores `mining_enabled`; pg_cron
  job `process-mining-securing`; migration 0105).

**State.** `npm run build` green. Migration head **0105**; still dark END-TO-END — the command
rejects while `mining_enabled='false'`, so the processor (which correctly ignores the flag) has
nothing to sweep; no flag flipped, no live DB write; PR-ready on `autopilot/20260703-064048`,
`main` untouched. Next: slice E (the read surface).

---

## 2026-07-04 — MINING-P12 SLICE C — the dark extraction command `0104` (`command_mining_extract` → private `mining_extract`)

**Request.** Implement slice C of the Phase 12 plan (recon §9): ONE new forward-only migration with
the two-layer extraction command, mirroring the exploration scan command's AS-BUILT form (0099 body
+ the 0100 changes) — same shape, envelopes, locking, and ACL — deviating only where the recon §8
decisions require (repeatability/cooldown instead of unique-discovery). No processor, no read
surface, no frontend, no `game_config` changes.

**Work done — NEW `supabase/migrations/20260618000104_mining_p12_extract_command.sql`** (migration
head moves **0103 → 0104**; `0001–0103` unedited):
- **Private `mining_extract(p_player, p_main_ship_id, p_request_id)`** — the 0099/0100 writer
  step-for-step: dark gate FIRST (`cfg_bool('mining_enabled')` → `feature_disabled` before ANY
  read/lock/write) → request-id validation → S2 canonical lock context →
  ownership-from-locked-snapshot → canonical payload hash → receipt lookup
  (`main_ship_space_command_receipts`; replay returns the first committed result;
  `request_id_payload_conflict` on hash mismatch — the EXACT 0099 mechanism, no new receipt
  system) → `mainship_space_validate_context` (settled `in_space` required; `destroyed` /
  `not_in_space` reasons) → `mainship_space_assert_cross_domain_exclusion` → live position under
  lock → NEAREST active `mining_fields` row within `cfg_num('mining_extract_radius')` via
  `osn_distance` (deterministic tie-break distance-then-name; none → `no_field_in_range`).
  **Deviations (recon decisions 2/4, all header-documented):** no discovered-filter and no
  ON CONFLICT race guard (repeatable; the S2 ship lock serializes concurrency, receipts dedupe
  replays); NEW cooldown step — the latest `mining_extractions.created_at` for (player, field)
  (the 0103 `(player_id, field_id, created_at desc)` index) must be older than
  `cfg_num('mining_extract_cooldown_seconds')`, else `{ok:false, reason:'cooldown',
  retry_after_seconds}` (failure writes NO receipt — 0064 posture — so the same request_id
  retries cleanly after the cooldown). On success: ONE extraction row inserted with
  `pending_bundle_json` = the field's `reward_bundle_json` verbatim + the resolved
  `main_ship_id`; success envelope in 0099's shape; receipt finalised atomically.
- **Public wrapper `command_mining_extract(p_main_ship_id, p_request_id)`** — the 0099 wrapper
  verbatim: auth check → `mining_enabled` gate BEFORE any ship/argument resolution (anti-probe;
  `{ok:false, code:'feature_disabled'}`) → `mainship_resolve_owned_ship` → delegate → the same
  reason→code/message map with `no_field_in_range`/`cooldown` replacing
  `no_site_in_range`/`already_discovered`; the `cooldown` failure passes `retry_after_seconds`
  through.
- **ACL verbatim from 0099:** `mining_extract` revoked from public/anon/authenticated, granted to
  service_role; `command_mining_extract` revoked from public/anon, granted to authenticated.
- DARK today: both gates reject every call; a successful extraction would only sit pending anyway —
  the securing processor arrives in slice D (unreachable today).

**Doc-sync (same step).** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`: the `mining_extractions` §1 row now names
`mining_extract` (0104) as the LIVE sole insert path (insert-only) with `process_mining_securing`
still FORTHCOMING; the §2 Mining row rewritten to present tense for the shipped command (wrapper →
private writer, receipts/S2/validate/exclusion reuse, cooldown + nearest-field rule) with slices
D/E still marked forthcoming — edge list stays all-DOWNWARD (Mining → OSN geometry/locks · Main
Ship read · Reference/Config reads · Bases/Reward deferred to slice D), exactly the Exploration
shape.

**State.** `npm run build` green. Migration head **0104**; still fully dark — the wrapper and
writer both server-reject while `mining_enabled='false'`; no flag flipped, no live DB write;
PR-ready on `autopilot/20260703-064048`, `main` untouched. Next: slice D
(`process_mining_securing`).

---

## 2026-07-04 — MINING-P12 SLICE B — mining schema migration `0103` (`mining_fields` + `mining_extractions`, dark, no writer exists)

**Request.** Implement slice B of the Phase 12 plan (recon §9): ONE new forward-only migration with
the two mining tables + seeds + RLS, mirroring the exploration schema slice 0098 and deviating only
where the recon §8 decisions require it. No functions, no cron, no `game_config` changes, no
frontend.

**Work done — NEW `supabase/migrations/20260618000103_mining_p12_fields_schema.sql`** (0098
structure/idioms; migration head moves **0102 → 0103**; `0001–0102` unedited):
- **`mining_fields`** — hidden static resource-field catalog, the 0098 `exploration_sites` shape
  verbatim: name-unique seed key; `space_x`/`space_y` with the finite-only CHECK idiom + the
  `[-10000,10000]²` envelope; deterministic `reward_bundle_json` (jsonb-object CHECK); `is_active`
  soft-disable. **RLS enabled with NO client policy and NO client grant** (anti-probe posture
  identical to 0098 — field coordinates/composition are never client-readable before extraction).
  Seeds 5 fields on the integer grid, near/far spread, distinct from the exploration sites, with
  ITEMS-ONLY bundles (decision 3) drawn from the EXISTING catalog rows: `ore` in every field
  (qty 2–3), `crystal` in three (qty 1–2), `artifact_core` in exactly one (qty 1) — per-item
  quantities in the 0098 magnitude; no metal scalar, so nothing can ever land in `base_resources`.
- **`mining_extractions`** — per-extraction state row: player + field FKs, `main_ship_id`
  (`on delete set null`, the 0100 resolver-fallback idiom), `pending_bundle_json` snapshot +
  `secured_at` (NULL = pending — the exploration as-built lifecycle verbatim; no `'{}'` default
  needed on a fresh table, unlike the 0099 migration-validity shim), `created_at` as the cooldown
  anchor. **THE deliberate deviation from 0098 (decision 2): NO `unique (player_id, field_id)`** —
  extraction is repeatable; one row per extraction; idempotency = the slice-C receipt convention;
  pacing = the per-(player, field) cooldown. Indexes: `(player_id, field_id, created_at desc)`
  (cooldown lookup) + `(player_id, created_at desc)` (the 0098 player-index idiom, serves the
  slice-E read surface). Own-row SELECT policy + `grant select to authenticated` only — NO write
  policy/grant; writers are the forthcoming slice-C command and slice-D processor.
- Forfeiture of pending bundles: DEFERRED with the documented 0100 posture (pending rows wait;
  destruction semantics are a future product decision) — stated in the migration header.

**Doc-sync (same step).** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`: §1 matrix gained the two rows —
`mining_fields` = Reference/Config (static hidden world data, NO runtime writer, server-only read);
`mining_extractions` = **Mining** (ONE owner system, two FORTHCOMING writer fns: slice-C
`mining_extract` inserts · slice-D `process_mining_securing` sets `secured_at`; DARK behind
`mining_enabled=false`, schema-only today) — and §2 gained the Mining system row (forthcoming
surfaces named; bundles items-only; deposits ONLY via `Reward.grant('mining', extraction_id, …)` —
`reward_grant` remains the sole depositor; edges all DOWNWARD in the Exploration shape; forbidden
column includes writing `base_resources` at all). No other section contradicts the new tables (the
"OSN geometry leaf" note already anticipated Mining as a later downward consumer).

**State.** `npm run build` green. Migration head **0103**; both tables exist DARK with NO writer
anywhere (nothing can insert until slice C ships); no flag flipped, no live DB write; PR-ready on
`autopilot/20260703-064048`, `main` untouched. Next: slice C (`command_mining_extract`).

## 2026-07-04 — MINING-P12 SLICE A — design decisions (self-approved) + dark config/flag migration `0102`

**Request.** Record the Phase 12 Mining design decisions and implement slice A: ONE new forward-only
migration seeding the dark gate + tunables. Nothing else — no tables, no functions, no grants, no
catalog rows, no frontend, no flag flipped.

**Design decisions (self-approved; full text + rationale in `MINING_P12_RECON.local.md` §8):**
1. **Extract shape:** mirror the exploration OSN-native template as a single
   `command_mining_extract` (prospect+extract in one command) — settled `in_space` under the S2
   lock + cross-domain exclusion, proximity via the existing `osn_distance` leaf against
   `mining_extract_radius`, pending extraction row secured later by a flag-ignoring securing
   processor when the ship settles safe (the 0099→0100 shape). Maximal reuse; no new engine surface.
2. **Repeatability:** mining is repeatable (no `unique(player_id, field_id)`); one extraction row
   per extraction, receipts idempotency, plus a server-enforced per-(player, field) cooldown from
   the latest extraction's `created_at` against `mining_extract_cooldown_seconds`.
3. **Reward landing zone:** item inventory via `reward_grant('mining', extraction_id, …)` reusing
   the EXISTING `item_types` rows `ore`/`crystal`/`artifact_core`; NO new catalog rows, NO writes to
   `base_resources` (that would add a second landing path to the Base-owned economy scalars). The
   `trade_goods` `'ore'` is a separate Trade Market catalog and is not touched.
4. **Field visibility:** hidden like `exploration_sites` (RLS, no client policy/grant);
   deterministic `reward_bundle_json` per field; the read surface reveals only fields the player
   has extracted from. Forfeiture of in-flight pending bundles DEFERRED with the exploration 0100
   posture (pending rows wait; destruction semantics are a future product decision).

**Slice plan** (recon §9): A=config/flag (this step) → B=`mining_fields`+`mining_extractions`
schema+seeds → C=`command_mining_extract` → D=securing processor → E=read surface → F=dark frontend
`src/features/mining/` → G=`verify:mining` script (must import `scripts/lib/verify-harness.mjs`).

**Work done — NEW `supabase/migrations/20260618000102_mining_p12_config_and_flag.sql`** (0097
structure/idioms; migration head moves **0101 → 0102**; `0001–0101` unedited):
- `game_config` seeds (established `on conflict (key) do nothing` upsert idiom):
  `mining_enabled='false'` (the dark gate — every later mining RPC must check it FIRST and
  reject-before-any-read), `mining_extract_radius='750'` (matches the exploration radius default;
  retune via config, no redeploy), `mining_extract_cooldown_seconds='300'`.
- Deliberately NO `item_types` rows (decision 3 — unlike 0097, which needed two new item classes).
- No table, no function, no grant, no cron; the keys are inert until slice C reads them.

**Doc-sync note:** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` needs NO change this slice — no new table, writer, or
cross-system edge exists yet (`game_config` stays Reference/Config, admin/migration sole writer);
the Mining ownership rows + §2 system row land with the slice-B schema, same-step (the 0097/0098
precedent).

**State.** `npm run build` green. Migration head **0102**; no flag flipped, no live DB write —
everything dark and server-rejected (`mining_enabled='false'`); PR-ready on
`autopilot/20260703-064048`, `main` untouched.

## 2026-07-04 — EXPLORATION CLEANUP step 4 (final) — delete dead `EXPLORATION_DISABLED_REASON` export; closes recon finding #3. **Exploration cleanup complete (findings 1–3 all fixed)**

**Request.** Fix finding #3 and close out the exploration cleanup pass. Repo-wide grep re-confirmed
`EXPLORATION_DISABLED_REASON` (`explorationTypes.ts:48`) had zero references outside the recon
scratch file; deleted the constant + its doc comment (2 lines) and nothing else. Rationale: the
panel deliberately collapses ALL failure envelopes without inspecting `reason`
(`ExplorationPanel.tsx:86`), so the constant was speculative dead code with no consumer and no
planned consumer — the dark surface stays server-driven either way.

**Cleanup pass summary (the trade-milestone-style audit of Phase 11, slices A–H / 0096–0101):**
- **Audit verdict:** boundaries acyclic and all edges downward; sole writers hold everywhere
  (`exploration_discoveries` = one owner system, two writer fns; `exploration_sites` = no runtime
  writer; `reward_grant` the sole depositor; `osn_distance` a pure IMMUTABLE leaf); dark gates
  consistent (all three client-callable surfaces reject-before-any-read while
  `exploration_enabled='false'`; the securing processor's flag exception documented as in-flight
  safety); every shim carries its retirement condition. Three cleanup-class findings, none severe.
- **Finding #1 (step 2):** `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` doc-sync — §14 processors table gained the
  `process_exploration_securing()` row; §7 gained the OSN-native as-built clarification (narrow
  self-approved scope amendment, recorded in the recon §3).
- **Finding #2 (step 3):** shared verify harness extracted to `scripts/lib/verify-harness.mjs`;
  `verify-exploration.mjs` repointed (pure extraction, identical environmental abort point);
  retirement plan: the 31 sibling verifiers adopt on next meaningful touch (`osn_distance`
  precedent, `SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md:75–78`).
- **Finding #3 (this step):** dead `EXPLORATION_DISABLED_REASON` export deleted.

**State.** `npm run build` green; `node --check scripts/verify-exploration.mjs` parses clean.
Migration head remains **0101**; no migration edited, no flag touched, `game_config` seeds
untouched; every exploration surface still dark/server-rejected; everything PR-ready on
`autopilot/20260703-064048`, `main` untouched. The exploration cleanup audit is **CLOSED**
(recon: `CLEANUP_EXPLORATION_RECON.local.md`, findings 1–3 all FIXED).

---

## 2026-07-04 — EXPLORATION CLEANUP step 3 — extract shared verify harness (`scripts/lib/verify-harness.mjs`); closes recon finding #2

**Request.** Fix finding #2 of the exploration cleanup recon: `scripts/verify-exploration.mjs` had
added the 32nd verbatim inline copy of the verify-script harness (the `loadEnv()` env loader +
URL/key resolution, the `ok/bad/Abort/die` reporting harness, and the throwaway-signup `newUser()`)
instead of extracting it to `scripts/lib/`. Touches ONLY the new module, the exploration verifier,
this file, and the recon scratch file — no migrations, no flags, no sibling scripts, no `package.json`.

**Work done — pure extraction, no behavior change:**
- **NEW `scripts/lib/verify-harness.mjs`** (next to the existing `verifier-teardown.mjs`, same
  module style): exports `loadEnv()` + `resolveEnv()` (anon key required → exit 2; service key
  OPTIONAL at this layer — a verifier that requires it asserts that itself), `Abort`/`die`,
  `createReporter()` (ok/bad + shared pass/fail counts), and `createUserFactory({url, anonKey,
  emailPrefix, createdUserIds})` → `newUser(tag)` (ids pushed immediately after creation for
  finally-teardown). Parameterized ONLY where the sibling comparison showed a variation point the
  exploration script actually relies on (email prefix, optional service key, caller-owned
  createdUserIds); no speculative knobs for sibling quirks it doesn't use.
- **`scripts/verify-exploration.mjs`** repointed at the module; its inline copies deleted. Every
  assertion, ordering, envelope check, and the teardown behavior are semantically identical.
- **RETIREMENT PLAN for the remaining duplication (stated in the module header):** the **31 sibling
  `verify-*.mjs` scripts still carry inline copies** and MUST adopt `verify-harness.mjs` the next
  time each is meaningfully touched — the documented `osn_distance` adopt-on-next-real-change
  precedent (`docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md:75–78`). New verifiers import from the harness from day one.

**Verification.** `node --check` parses both files clean. `node scripts/verify-exploration.mjs`
reaches the IDENTICAL sandbox environmental abort as before the extraction (`✗ ABORTED — signup
failed: fetch failed`, exit 1 — the same no-reachable-Supabase blocker the slice-H entry records),
proving the harness wires up identically: `resolveEnv` resolved the keys, the shared `newUser`'s
`die` threw `Abort` through the script's `instanceof Abort` catch, and the shared reporter printed
the summary. `npm run build` green. Finding #2 of `CLEANUP_EXPLORATION_RECON.local.md` is FIXED
(marked in the recon; finding #3 remains).

---

## 2026-07-04 — EXPLORATION CLEANUP step 2 — ARCHITECTURE.md doc-sync (docs-only; closes recon finding #1)

**Request.** Fix finding #1 of the exploration cleanup recon: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` contradicted the
as-built Phase 11 code — §14's processors/cron table omitted `process_exploration_securing()` (a live
60s pg_cron job since 0100), and §7 still implied no exploration processor exists ("Later:
`process_exploration_ticks()`"). Docs-only: no code, no migrations, no flags.

**Scope amendment (self-approved, recorded in the recon §3).** The cleanup's locked scope is amended to
also allow `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, restricted to exactly these two out-of-sync spots — a law doc
contradicting as-built code is a defect under the doc-sync principle; ARCHITECTURE.md's exclusion from
the original MAY-touch list was an oversight in the scope lock itself.

**Work done — two surgical edits in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`:**
- **§14 processors table:** added one row — `process_exploration_securing()` · every 60s · deposits
  pending exploration discovery bundles via `reward_grant('exploration', discovery_id, …)` once the
  carrying main ship settles safe (home / `at_location`); deliberately ignores `exploration_enabled`
  (in-flight safety); pg_cron job `process-exploration-securing`, migration 0100.
- **§7 activity list:** added an as-built bullet — Phase 11 shipped exploration OSN-native, outside the
  presence dispatch, with its own securing processor (dark behind `exploration_enabled='false'`;
  mirrors the `docs/ACTIVITIES.md` §2 as-built clarification); the `explore_derelict` presence branch
  stays deliberately unwired. The "Later" line now names `process_mining_ticks()` /
  `process_trade_ticks()` and a *presence-domain* `process_exploration_ticks()` only as a hypothetical
  future form — it no longer implies the exploration processor is unbuilt.

**State.** `npm run build` green (docs-only sanity check). Migration head remains **0101**; no flag
touched; finding #1 of `CLEANUP_EXPLORATION_RECON.local.md` is FIXED (marked in the recon; findings
#2–#3 remain for the next steps).

---

## 2026-07-04 — EXPLORATION-P11 SLICE H (final): `verify:exploration` dark-posture script + wiring. **Phase 11 Exploration: dark implementation complete (slices A–H)**

**Request.** The exploration verify script + `package.json` wiring + this closing entry. Touches ONLY
`scripts/verify-exploration.mjs`, `package.json`, and this file; migrations `0001–0101` unedited; no
CI/workflow files; no flags flipped.

**Design decisions (self-approved).**
1. **`verify:exploration` wired in `package.json` exactly like the `verify:mainship-*` entries** (one
   `node scripts/…` line in the verify cluster). **No CI/workflow edits** — the narrowest compliant wiring;
   the human can extend the existing CI pattern later; this loop does not touch workflows.
2. **The script proves the DARK POSTURE and contracts only — it activates nothing.** It never writes
   `game_config`, never sets `exploration_enabled`, and creates nothing beyond the sibling scripts'
   throwaway-test-player convention (one signup, tracked and deleted by the shared
   `scripts/lib/verifier-teardown.mjs` when a service key is present; without one, teardown is skipped with
   a note — the `verify-m3/m4` precedent). The sibling `verify-mainship-send.mjs` DOES flip its own flag via
   `set_game_config` (its lines 49/98/105) — that part was **deliberately not copied**, and the script says
   so in its header: lit-path verification is deferred to the activation checklist below. `SUPABASE_SERVICE_
   ROLE_KEY` is OPTIONAL (teardown only); every assertion runs with anon/authenticated clients.

**The script asserts, in order** (idioms: env loader + ok/bad + Abort + exit codes from `verify-m45.mjs:12–41,
147–149`; throwaway `newUser` from `verify-m45.mjs:49–57`; client-role ACL-denial loop from
`verify-m45.mjs:135–137`; read-only `cfgVal` query shape from `verify-mainship-send.mjs:50`, run as the client
role; teardown from `verify-mainship-send.mjs:206–224` minus the flag entry):
- **(a) dark rejection** — `command_exploration_scan(ZERO, ZERO)` → `{ok:false, code:'feature_disabled'}`
  (0099/0100 wrapper envelope; the wrapper gates before ship resolution, so a zero id gets the same
  anti-probe answer) and `get_my_exploration_discoveries()` → `{ok:false, reason:'exploration_disabled'}`
  (0101), both for an authenticated throwaway user.
- **(b) no site leak** — authenticated `select` on `exploration_sites` → denial or 0 rows (0098 posture);
  `exploration_discoveries` → 0 rows for a fresh user (own-row RLS).
- **(c) internal surfaces locked** — client-role rpc calls to `exploration_scan`,
  `process_exploration_securing`, `osn_distance` all denied; plus anon denied on both public RPCs.
- **(d) config presence (read-only)** — `exploration_enabled` reads `false`, `exploration_scan_radius`
  reads `750`, compared tolerantly of the jsonb storage form (see Bugs below).

---

### Phase 11 Exploration — dark implementation complete (slices A–H)

**The six migrations (`0096–0101`; head `0095 → 0101`, all forward-only, nothing shipped edited):**
- **0096** — engine carrier made activity-agnostic: `fleet_movements.reward_source_type` (+ closed CHECK) and
  `movement_attach_cargo(…, source_type default 'combat')`; `process_fleet_movements` deposits under the
  carried type. Combat behavior unchanged.
- **0097** — the four-item exploration reward set (`scan_data` + `anomaly_shard` seeded; `blueprint_fragment`
  + `artifact_core` reused from 0039) + the `exploration_enabled='false'` dark gate.
- **0098** — hidden `exploration_sites` (RLS, NO client policy/grant; OSN coordinate convention; deterministic
  `reward_bundle_json`; 5 seeds) + own-row `exploration_discoveries` with `unique (player_id, site_id)`.
- **0099** — dark write path: `osn_distance` leaf + `exploration_scan` private writer (S2 locks, 0055
  receipts idempotency, reject-before-any-read) + `command_exploration_scan` wrapper +
  `exploration_scan_radius='750'`; pending-bundle accrual columns.
- **0100** — securing: `exploration_discoveries.main_ship_id`, the race-guarded re-created writer, and
  `process_exploration_securing()` (60s cron) → `reward_grant('exploration', discovery_id, …)` when the
  carrying ship settles safe (home / `at_location`); in-flight-safe (no flag check); double-guarded
  idempotency.
- **0101** — dark read surface `get_my_exploration_discoveries()` (reveal-after-discovery; the ONLY client
  path to site data).

**Frontend surface (Slice G):** `src/features/exploration/` (types + api + `ExplorationPanel`), mounted in
`GalaxyMapScreen`'s OSN overlay stack; server-driven visibility — renders nothing while the server answers
`exploration_disabled`.

**The corrected securing law (Slice E re-decision):** OSN-native activities never traverse `fleet_movements`,
so Exploration secures via its OWN processor calling `reward_grant` directly — the same sole depositor the
fleet return branch uses; `movement_attach_cargo` remains the fleet-domain carrier only (combat today).
`docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` + `docs/ACTIVITIES.md` carry the as-built law.

**ACTIVATION CHECKLIST — for the human owner only (nothing below is done by this loop):**
1. **Flip `exploration_enabled` → `'true'` — that is the ONLY switch.** The cron
   (`process-exploration-securing`), both RPCs, the read surface, and the panel are already in place and
   fail closed until the flip; the securing processor deliberately ignores the flag (in-flight safety) and
   is inert while no discoveries exist.
2. **Reposition the `GalaxyMap.tsx:390` bottom-left legend** ("N locations · M moving · drag to pan …") —
   the ExplorationPanel also renders bottom-left when lit and will cover it. Cosmetic; deferred because a
   dark panel covers nothing today.
3. **Decide destruction-forfeiture semantics for pending exploration data BEFORE OSN main-ship combat
   ships.** v1 never forfeits: a pending discovery waits and secures after recovery. Fine while destruction
   is rare/dev-only; a real combat loop needs an explicit forfeit-or-keep rule (ACTIVITIES.md §2 note).
4. **`activity_start`/`explore_derelict` is deliberately unwired in v1** (OSN-native-only scope decision,
   Slice F). Do not "finish" that dispatch branch without a product decision.
5. **Before any flip: run `verify:exploration` (dark posture) against a dev DB, then the lit-path checks
   there** — flip the flag ON THE DEV DB only, scan from a settled in-space ship near a seeded site, watch
   the discovery appear pending, dock/return home, confirm the cron deposits (metal → base, items →
   inventory, `secured_at` set, `reward_grants` row `('exploration', discovery_id)`), and re-run
   `verify:exploration` after re-darkening. Production flips remain a human production-gate action
   (PROD_GATE_APPROVAL_POLICY).

**Nothing in slices A–H flipped a flag, merged anything, deployed anything, or touched production.** All
work sits PR-ready on `autopilot/20260703-064048`; every exploration surface is server-rejected while
`exploration_enabled='false'`; `main` untouched.

**State (this slice).** `npm run build` green; `node --check scripts/verify-exploration.mjs` parses clean;
`node scripts/verify-exploration.mjs` in this sandbox aborts at signup with `fetch failed` (no reachable
Supabase) — the identical ENVIRONMENT blocker `verify:m3/m4` record, not a syntax/logic failure. Migration
head remains **0101**.

**Bugs / fixes**
- **jsonb type mismatch in the step-4 config assertions (reviewer-caught; fixed).** `game_config.value` is
  **jsonb** (`0003:8`), so the seeded literals `'false'` (0097) / `'750'` (0099) store as JSON boolean/number
  and supabase-js returns JS `false` / `750` — the original string comparisons (`v === 'false'` /
  `v === '750'`) would have false-failed step 4 on exactly the healthy dev DB the activation checklist
  targets (masked here because the sandbox aborts at signup, before step 4; no sibling script string-compares
  a `cfgVal` result — they only capture-and-restore — so there was no precedent to copy). Fixed to
  storage-form-tolerant comparisons (`String(v) === 'false'` / `Number(v) === 750`), mirroring how the
  server's `cfg_bool`/`cfg_num` (`0046:23` idiom) are storage-form-agnostic; noted in-line in the script.

## 2026-07-04 — EXPLORATION-P11 SLICE G: dark frontend surface `src/features/exploration/` (scan control + discoveries panel; renders nothing while the server says dark). Frontend only — no migration

**Request.** The exploration client surface: scan control + discoveries panel in a new feature folder,
integrated with the OSN in-space controls. NO new migration; nothing outside the feature folder + one
integration point + docs.

**Design decisions (self-approved).**
1. **Server-driven visibility, no client flag constant.** The panel calls `get_my_exploration_discoveries()`
   on mount/lifecycle change and renders **nothing unless the server affirmatively answers `{ok:true}`** —
   the `exploration_disabled` dark envelope (and any transport failure) fails closed to `null`. This follows
   the fail-closed side of the trade client idiom (all `{ok:false, reason}` shapes collapse quietly; nothing
   throws into the render path — `tradeApi.ts`/`MarketPanel.tsx`) while deliberately NOT copying trade's
   compile-time `TRADE_MARKET_ENABLED` constant: visibility is the SERVER's answer alone. The UI is not the
   control anyway — the server rejects every exploration RPC while dark (fail-closed law, both sides).
2. **Placement with the OSN in-space controls.** The panel mounts in `GalaxyMapScreen`'s map-overlay stack
   (where the OSN command surfaces live: PortNavPanel top-left, DockServicesPanel top-right, SpaceStopControls
   bottom-right) at **bottom-left**, receiving the ship id + `status`/`spatial_state` the screen already
   threads to its OSN siblings. Single feature folder `src/features/exploration/`; no new route (matches how
   the trade/dock surfaces integrate — overlay panels, not routes).
3. **request_id idiom copied from the existing command clients:** one `crypto.randomUUID()` per intentional
   submit (the `MarketPanel` idiom; the server dedups on `(main_ship_id, request_id)`), a synchronous
   in-flight ref so a same-tick double-click can't mint a second id, and disabled buttons while in flight.

**Work done** — three new files + one integration point; no migration, `0001–0101` unedited:
- **`src/features/exploration/explorationTypes.ts`** — framework-free types mirroring the server contracts
  exactly (`CommandExplorationScanResult` from 0099/0100's wrapper; `ExplorationDiscovery` /
  `GetMyExplorationDiscoveriesResult` from 0101: discovery_id, site_name, space_x, space_y, discovered_at,
  secured_at, bundle), the `isSettledInSpace` predicate (0055 model: `in_space` ⇔ `stationary`; drives only
  the button — the server stays authoritative), and the scan reason→message copy map in the
  `spaceStopCommand.ts` style (`feature_disabled`, `invalid_request`, `request_conflict`, `no_ship`,
  `ship_destroyed`, `not_in_space`, `busy_legacy`, `no_site_in_range`, `already_discovered`,
  `not_authenticated`, `unavailable`).
- **`src/features/exploration/explorationApi.ts`** — two thin `supabase.rpc` wrappers
  (`commandExplorationScan(mainShipId, requestId)`, `getMyExplorationDiscoveries()`); transport/DB errors
  normalize to `{ok:false, code/reason:'unavailable'}` (tradeApi idiom — never throw into render).
- **`src/features/exploration/ExplorationPanel.tsx`** — reads discoveries on mount + lifecycleKey change
  (the `useDockServices` re-fetch idiom); early-returns `null` unless `result.ok`; Scan button enabled only
  when settled in space (disabled with the truthful hint "Stop in open space to scan." otherwise); on
  success shows "Discovered <name>." and refreshes; failures show the server message (fallback: copy map).
  Discovery rows: name, rounded coordinates, local discovery time, and a Pending/Secured badge from
  `secured_at`. Styling/testids match the neighboring OSN overlay panels.
- **Integration (the ONE point):** `src/features/map/GalaxyMapScreen.tsx` — `ExplorationPanel` mounted
  directly after `DockServicesPanel` in the map-area overlay block, passing
  `mainShipId`/`shipStatus`/`shipSpatialState` + the lifecycle key the siblings already use.

**Panel renders nothing in production today because the server returns `exploration_disabled` — no flag was
touched.** `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` NOT edited: verified it does not document client surfaces per system
(the Trade Market row lists RPCs/flags only; trade's UI is not listed), so exploration's UI is not added
either.

**State.** Frontend-only; migration head remains **0101**. `npm run build` green (`tsc -b && vite build`,
**144 modules** — up from 141 with the three new files); `npx eslint` on the new folder + the integration
file: clean. `verify:m3`/`verify:m4` fail only on `fetch failed` (no reachable Supabase from this sandbox)
and `verify:m45` needs `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — the recorded environmental posture; no code/assertion
failure. `main` untouched.

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none — additive dark UI; server rejects everything while dark, and the panel renders nothing on that
  answer.)_

---

## 2026-07-04 — EXPLORATION-P11 SLICE F: dark read surface `get_my_exploration_discoveries()` (reveal-after-discovery) + ACTIVITIES.md as-built reconciliation

**Request.** The exploration read surface: one server RPC exposing the caller's own discoveries (with the joined
site data), dark-gated; plus the reviewer-flagged ACTIVITIES.md lifecycle reconciliation. No frontend yet.

**Design decisions (self-approved).**
1. **The client never reads `exploration_sites` directly.** Reveal-after-discovery goes through ONE server read
   RPC that joins the player's OWN `exploration_discoveries` to the site rows and returns only discovered sites.
   The 0098 no-client-policy posture on sites is untouched: an undiscovered site's existence/name/coordinates
   stay unreachable **by construction** (a site row is reachable exclusively through one of the caller's own
   discovery rows; `where d.player_id = auth.uid()`). Same spirit as the `get_my_current_dock_services` (0069)
   read surface — already-authoritative, player-scoped, everything derived server-side.
2. **Dark-gated FIRST, copying the 0087 `get_market_offers` read idiom exactly** (`0087:46–50`): auth check,
   then `if not cfg_bool('exploration_enabled') → {ok:false, reason:'exploration_disabled'}` BEFORE any
   discovery/site read — the identical envelope regardless of caller state, so nothing can be probed while
   dark (matches the `trade_market_disabled`/`trade_relief_disabled` reason-token style).
3. **Exploration v1 is OSN-native ONLY (explicit scope decision).** The `activity_start`/`explore_derelict`
   location-presence dispatch is deliberately NOT wired in Phase 11 (ROADMAP: "scan in OSN proximity … where
   applicable"); `activity_start` still raises on `explore_derelict` — intended behavior, recorded in
   ACTIVITIES.md so nobody "finishes" the branch by accident.

**Work done** — one new migration `20260618000101_exploration_p11_read_surface.sql` (head **0100 → 0101**):
`get_my_exploration_discoveries()` — `language plpgsql stable security definer`; no arguments (player =
`auth.uid()`); flag gate first; then one read-only aggregate: the caller's discoveries joined to
`exploration_sites`, each as `{discovery_id, site_name, space_x, space_y, discovered_at, secured_at, bundle}`
(bundle = the row's `pending_bundle_json` snapshot; `secured_at` null = pending, non-null = deposited), ordered
`discovered_at desc`, `[]`-coalesced; envelope `{ok:true, discoveries:[…]}`. **No write anywhere** (single
SELECT aggregate). Discovered-then-disabled sites stay visible — the discovery is the player's own history.
ACL (0087 idiom): revoke from public/anon; grant execute to authenticated only. Dark today because the gate
rejects while `exploration_enabled='false'`.

**Doc sync (same step).** (a) `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` — the Exploration row's surface list now names
`get_my_exploration_discoveries()` (read-only, dark-gated, the ONLY client path to site data, strictly
post-discovery). (b) `docs/ACTIVITIES.md` — the reviewer-flagged reconciliation as a marked **"Phase 11
as-built clarification (not a new design)"** note in §2: OSN-native activities secure pending rewards when the
carrying ship next settles SAFE (home or docked `at_location`, 0055 model) via the activity's own processor +
`reward_grant`; the "home arrival" wording is the fleet_movements-domain form (combat); destruction-forfeiture
deferred; Exploration v1 OSN-native-only dispatch decision recorded.

**State.** Forward-only; migration head **0101**; `0001–0100` unedited. No flag flipped; no frontend (next
slice). `main` untouched. `npm run build` green; `verify:m3`/`verify:m4` fail only on `fetch failed` (no
reachable Supabase from this sandbox) and `verify:m45` needs `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — the recorded
environmental posture; no code/assertion failure.

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none — additive read-only surface; the ACTIVITIES.md fleet-domain wording ambiguity is reconciled by the
  marked as-built note.)_

## 2026-07-04 — EXPLORATION-P11 SLICE E: dark securing/deposit path — `process_exploration_securing` cron → `reward_grant('exploration', …)` on safe settlement. ⚠ DESIGN RE-DECISION: corrects the Slice-C carrier law

**Request.** Secure pending exploration discoveries into real rewards when the scanning ship next settles safe,
via Exploration's OWN cron processor (the ACTIVITIES.md "own cron per activity" template). Everything stays dark.

**⚠ DESIGN RE-DECISION (self-approved) — the Slice-C carrier law was wrong for OSN-native scanning.**
Slice C's SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES row said exploration deposits ride `movement_attach_cargo(…, 'exploration')`. That
path is **UNREACHABLE** for OSN scanning: an OSN in-space ship never traverses `fleet_movements` — the S2
posture never locks legacy movements, `mainship_space_assert_cross_domain_exclusion` rejects a ship claimed by
one, and OSN has no HOME leg (`origin_not_anchored` fails closed) — so the fleet carrier can never fire for it.
The engine contract Exploration actually reuses is one level down: **`reward_grant` is THE sole secured-deposit
owner and idempotency owner (`reward_grants UNIQUE (source_type, source_id)`), and the activity accrues pending
value on its own state until a safe arrival.** Exploration's own processor therefore calls
`reward_grant('exploration', discovery_id, player, base, bundle)` directly — exactly as
`process_fleet_movements` calls it for fleet returns. `movement_attach_cargo` remains the carrier for
fleet_movements-domain activities ONLY (Slice A stays correct and is used by combat today). Dependency direction
stays acyclic and DOWNWARD: Exploration → {OSN geometry/locks (read), Main Ship (read), Bases (read: deposit
target), Reward (grant)}; OSN and the arrival processors are NOT edited and never call into Exploration.
SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES corrected in the SAME step (matrix + Exploration row).

**Work done** — one new migration `20260618000100_exploration_p11_securing_processor.sql` (head **0099 → 0100**):
- **`exploration_discoveries.main_ship_id`** — FK → `main_ship_instances` `on delete set null`; records WHICH
  ship holds the unsecured scan data. NULL only possible for legacy/deleted-ship rows; securing falls back to
  the player's canonical main ship (`mainship_resolve_owned_ship(player, null)`, the 0081 shared resolver).
- **`exploration_scan` re-created from the 0099 body with EXACTLY TWO changes** (diff-proven; ACL re-asserted
  verbatim): (a) the discovery insert records `main_ship_id`; (b) **race-guard fix** — the insert is now
  `on conflict (player_id, site_id) do nothing` and 0 rows inserted returns a truthful `already_discovered`
  instead of a raw unique-violation exception on a same-player concurrent scan (failure reasons write no
  receipt — the 0064 posture — so retries stay deterministic).
- **`process_exploration_securing()`** — Exploration's OWN cron processor (security definer;
  internal/service_role only, 0033 ACL idiom). `secured_at is null` rows via `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`; resolves
  the carrying ship (row's `main_ship_id`, else canonical); secures ONLY if settled **SAFE** per the 0055 state
  model — `spatial_state in ('home','at_location')` (constraints tie these to `status='home'` /
  `status='stationary'`, 0055:151–153 / 0055:145–147) — never in_transit/in_space/destroyed/legacy-NULL;
  resolves the deposit base with the 0050 idiom (`from bases where player_id=… and status='active' order by
  created_at limit 1`) and SKIPS (row stays pending) rather than granting with a null base — `reward_grant`
  would silently drop the metal half; then `reward_grant('exploration', d.id, …)` + `secured_at = now()`.
  **Idempotency double-guarded:** the `secured_at` filter (fast path) + `reward_grants` UNIQUE
  (source_type, source_id) (the law — can never double-deposit). **No forfeiture in this slice:** pending rows
  simply wait (a destroyed ship secures after recovery lands it home); destruction semantics for pending scan
  data are a future product decision, deliberately not invented here.
- **IN-FLIGHT SAFETY (0064 precedent, stated in the header):** the processor does NOT check
  `exploration_enabled` — accrued pending value must never be stranded by an emergency flag-off. Naturally
  inert today: no discovery rows can exist while scan is dark.
- **Cron:** `process-exploration-securing` every 60s via the 0033 idiom (guarded `cron.unschedule` DO-block +
  `'* * * * *'` — pg_cron rejects `'60 seconds'`). Cadence rationale: securing is not latency-sensitive;
  matches the location-state tick's order of magnitude. Cadence summary: movement 30s · combat 3s ·
  worldstate 60s · space arrivals (0058) · **exploration securing 60s**.

**State.** Forward-only; migration head **0100**; `0001–0099` unedited. No flag flipped (`exploration_enabled`
stays `'false'`; the scan writer + wrapper still dark-reject first). No frontend. `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`
corrected in the SAME step: the Exploration row now carries the securing law (own processor →
`Reward.grant('exploration', discovery_id)`; `movement_attach_cargo` = fleet-domain carrier ONLY, with the
unreachability rationale; edges listed, all downward, acyclic), and the matrix row records the writer SET
(`exploration_scan` inserts · `process_exploration_securing` sets `secured_at`) under the ONE Exploration
owner system. `main` untouched. `npm run build` green; `verify:m3`/`verify:m4` fail only on `fetch failed`
(no reachable Supabase from this sandbox) and `verify:m45` needs `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — the recorded
environmental posture; no code/assertion failure.

**Bugs / fixes**
- **Slice-C carrier law unreachable for OSN scanning (doc/design defect).** Fixed by the re-decision above —
  corrected in SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES the same step; no shipped code implemented the wrong law (the deposit path
  did not exist until this slice), so this is a doc/design correction, not a behavior change.
- **Same-player concurrent-scan race (0099).** Two concurrent scans of the same site could raise a raw unique
  violation instead of a clean reason. Fixed in the re-created writer via `on conflict … do nothing` +
  `already_discovered`.

## 2026-07-04 — EXPLORATION-P11 SLICE D: dark `command_exploration_scan` — OSN-proximity scan → pending discovery bundle (server-rejected while `exploration_enabled=false`; nothing deposits yet)

**Request.** The exploration write path: an OSN-proximity scan that records a per-player discovery with a
PENDING (not yet deposited) reward bundle. Deposit wiring is deliberately NOT in this slice.

**Design decisions (self-approved).**
1. **Geometry is OSN's concern; Exploration depends on it DOWNWARD.** New pure IMMUTABLE leaf
   `osn_distance(ax,ay,bx,by) → double precision` — the exact euclidean formula the movement writers already
   use inline (`sqrt(power(bx-ax,2)+power(by-ay,2))`, verified at `0007:105`, `0057:179`, `0067:319`). The
   shipped movement-writer bodies were NOT re-created just to swap their one-line inline sqrt: a single
   arithmetic expression is below the duplication bar, and re-creating proven critical writers for a cosmetic
   swap adds regression risk with zero behavior gain. **Future re-definitions of those writers should adopt
   the helper when next touched for real changes** (also recorded in SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES).
2. **Accrual law (ACTIVITIES.md):** the activity accrues pending rewards on ITS OWN state. The discovery row
   snapshots the site's bundle at scan time — new columns `pending_bundle_json jsonb not null default '{}'`
   (CHECK object; the default is a migration-validity shim only — retirement is behavioral: the sole writer
   ALWAYS snapshots a real bundle, so no row ever relies on it) and `secured_at timestamptz` (NULL = pending;
   set ONLY by the deposit slice's securing path). **This slice mints nothing into inventory** — no
   inventory/base/reward/movement write anywhere in the scan path.
3. **Scan preconditions:** ship settled OSN in-space (`mainship_space_validate_context` state = `in_space`,
   which the 0055 constraints tie to `status='stationary'`; in transit / docked / home / legacy all reject),
   not claimed by another domain (`mainship_space_assert_cross_domain_exclusion` — the 0064
   arrival-processor posture, reused not re-derived), within `exploration_scan_radius` (new `game_config`
   tunable, default **750** — same order as the world's port/proximity scales, tunable without redeploy) of an
   `is_active` site the player has not discovered. Nearest-first, deterministic tie-break (distance, then name).

**Work done** — one new migration `20260618000099_exploration_p11_scan_command.sql` (head bump **0098 → 0099**):
- **`osn_distance`** — `language sql immutable strict`; internal posture (no client grant; service_role for CI
  parity with the S2 helpers).
- **`exploration_discoveries` + pending columns** (decision 2 above).
- **`exploration_scan(p_player, p_main_ship_id, p_request_id)`** — PRIVATE service-role/internal writer; the
  **sole writer** of `exploration_discoveries`. Ordered body: (1) **DARK GATE FIRST** —
  `if not cfg_bool('exploration_enabled') → feature_disabled` BEFORE any other read/lock/write (0097
  reject-before-any-read law, 0070 idiom); (2) null request_id → `invalid_request_id`; (3) S2 canonical
  blocking lock (ship → fleet → coordinate movement → presence) — `missing_ship` / lock status; (4) ownership
  from the LOCKED snapshot → `not_owned`; (5) canonical payload hash (no coordinate body — 0064 stop idiom);
  (6) **receipts idempotency REUSED EXACTLY** — `main_ship_space_command_receipts` (0055), lookup AFTER ship
  lock + ownership (0064 order): verbatim replay of the first committed `result_json`, or
  `request_id_payload_conflict`; (7) `validate_context` → `destroyed` / `not_in_space` unless settled
  `in_space`; (8) cross-domain exclusion → forwarded reason; (9) ship coords under lock; (10) nearest
  undiscovered active site within radius via `osn_distance` — else `already_discovered` (an in-range active
  site exists but all are this player's discoveries) or `no_site_in_range`; (11) insert the discovery with the
  bundle snapshot (`secured_at` NULL); (12) receipt insert atomic with the discovery (movement_id null).
- **`command_exploration_scan(p_main_ship_id, p_request_id)`** — authenticated public wrapper (0083 idiom):
  auth → **anti-probe flag gate** (while dark, identical answer regardless of input — no hidden-site probing) →
  `mainship_resolve_owned_ship` (selected owned ship or sole-ship shim; UI never trusted) → delegate →
  narrow reason→code/message map. Reason set: `feature_disabled`, `invalid_request_id`,
  `request_id_payload_conflict`, `missing_ship`/`not_owned`→`no_ship`, `destroyed`, `not_in_space`,
  `active_legacy_movement`→`busy_legacy`, `no_site_in_range`, `already_discovered`, else `unavailable`.
- **`exploration_scan_radius` = `'750'`** seeded `on conflict (key) do nothing`.
- **ACL (targeted 0083/0095 idiom):** `osn_distance` + `exploration_scan` revoked from public/anon/
  authenticated, granted to service_role only; `command_exploration_scan` revoked from public/anon, granted to
  authenticated — dark today because both the wrapper gate and the writer's first check reject.

**Nothing deposits yet — pending bundles only.** The deposit-on-arrival wiring through the Slice-A
activity-agnostic carrier (`movement_attach_cargo(…, 'exploration')`) is the NEXT slice.

**State.** Forward-only; migration head **0099**; `0001–0098` unedited. No flag flipped
(`exploration_enabled` stays `'false'`; it is read, never written). No frontend change.
`docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` synced in the SAME step: matrix + Exploration row now name `exploration_scan` as
sole writer via the dark `command_exploration_scan`, enumerate the reused OSN machinery, and a new note records
the `osn_distance` leaf ("pure/immutable, consumed downward by activities; movement writers adopt it when next
re-defined for real changes"). `main` untouched. `npm run build` green; `verify:m3`/`verify:m4` fail only on
`fetch failed` (no reachable Supabase from this sandbox) and `verify:m45` needs `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` —
the recorded environmental posture; no code/assertion failure.

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none — additive dark write path; reuses the proven receipts/lock/validation machinery unchanged.)_

## 2026-07-04 — EXPLORATION-P11 SLICE C: hidden `exploration_sites` + per-player `exploration_discoveries` (tables + seed + RLS only; no RPC, no client path, fully dark)

**Request.** Exploration domain schema: the hidden static site table and the per-player discovery ledger —
tables + seed + RLS only; no RPCs, no processors, no client paths; everything stays dark.

**Design decisions (self-approved).**
1. **Sites are hidden — server-only read, fail-closed by construction.** `exploration_sites` is migration-seeded
   static world data with NO runtime writer and — unlike `locations`/`item_types` — NO public read: a hidden
   site's coordinates must never be client-readable before discovery. RLS is ENABLED with **no client policies
   at all and no anon/authenticated grant**; future SECURITY DEFINER exploration functions reach it as owner.
   There is nothing for the UI to hide — the client simply cannot see the table.
2. **Per-player discovery state in its own table** `exploration_discoveries` with `unique (player_id, site_id)`
   (+ a `(player_id, discovered_at desc)` index). **Sole writer = the Exploration system** (its future
   RPC/processor — nothing writes it yet). Own-row select only, copying the `reward_grants_select_own` idiom
   (`0015:18–21`); no insert/update/delete policy, no write grant; `grant select` to authenticated only.
3. **v1 reward semantics: deterministic `reward_bundle_json` per site** in the EXACT pending-bundle shape the
   carrier already transports (`{ "metal": N, "items": [{item_id, quantity}] }`, the 0040/0041 shape; CHECK
   `jsonb_typeof = 'object'`) — reuses the Slice-A activity-agnostic deposit path byte-for-byte with zero new
   roll logic. Weighted "discovery rolls" are an additive later change and, if they come, must reuse/extract the
   combat loot-roll helper as ONE shared leaf, never a copy. `is_active boolean not null default true` lets a
   bad seed be disabled without deleting world data (no destructive cleanup).

**Coordinate representation — copied from OSN, no second convention.** Column names `space_x`/`space_y` from
`main_ship_instances` (`0054:33–36`); `double precision`; finite-only CHECKs via the
`<> 'NaN'::double precision` idiom and the immutable world envelope `[-10000,10000]^2`, both verbatim from
`main_ship_space_movements` (`0055:56–63`), matching the movement writer's inclusive bounds gate
(`0057:58–59, 95–96`). Seeds use integer-grid values (the 0070 command canonicalizes targets to the integer
grid) well inside the envelope — every site is a legal open-space target.

**Work done** — one new migration `20260618000098_exploration_p11_sites_schema.sql` (head bump **0097 → 0098**):
the two tables above + five idempotent seeds (natural `name` unique key + `on conflict (name) do nothing` —
the 0002 world-seed idiom; NOT fixed uuids, matching how sectors/zones/locations seed). Seed inventory
(bundles draw ONLY from the Slice-B reward set; metal calibrated to the 0041 combat scale of ~10–40/wave):
- `Derelict Listening Post` (−1200, 850) — 25 metal, scan_data ×3 (common)
- `Shattered Survey Buoy` (2100, −1400) — 30 metal, scan_data ×2 + anomaly_shard ×1 (common)
- `Anomalous Debris Field` (−2600, −1900) — 40 metal, anomaly_shard ×2 (uncommon)
- `Silent Foundry Wreck` (3300, 2500) — 60 metal, scan_data ×2 + blueprint_fragment ×1 (rare)
- `Precursor Vault Signal` (−4100, 3600) — 100 metal, anomaly_shard ×1 + artifact_core ×1 (epic)

**State.** Forward-only; migration head **0098**; `0001–0097` unedited. No function created → no execute-surface
relock needed (0054 precedent). No flag added/read/flipped — the feature stays server-rejected behind
`exploration_enabled=false` (0097) with no RPC even existing. `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` synced in the SAME
step: §1 matrix gains `exploration_sites` (Reference/Config; NO runtime writer; **server-only** read) and
`exploration_discoveries` (Exploration future writer; owner-read); §2 gains the **Exploration** system row with
the dark gate inline (like Trade Market) and the carrier-reuse law (`movement_attach_cargo(…, 'exploration')`,
never a parallel deposit path). `main` untouched; no frontend, no workflow, no verifier change.
`npm run build` green; `verify:m3`/`verify:m4` fail only on `fetch failed` (no reachable Supabase from this
sandbox) and `verify:m45` needs `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — the recorded environmental posture; no
code/assertion failure.

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none — additive schema + seed; no writer, no reader, no behavior.)_

---

## 2026-07-04 — EXPLORATION-P11 SLICE B: reward-item catalog entries + `exploration_enabled=false` dark flag (foundations only; nothing client-reachable, no behavior change)

**Request.** Exploration foundations: the reward item catalog entries and the dark capability flag. No gameplay
logic, no RPC, no table, nothing reachable by clients.

**Design decisions (self-approved).**
1. **Reuse the existing item-catalog + `player_inventory` path** that pirate loot uses (0039/0040/0041) — no new
   inventory table, no new depositor. `reward_grant` stays the sole depositor; its item validation is
   catalog-driven (`exists (select 1 from item_types where item_id = …)`, `0040:78`; same guard in
   `inventory_deposit`, `0039:81`), so it recognizes the new ids with **zero code change** — seeding the catalog
   row IS the enablement.
2. **The ACTIVITIES.md §3 exploration reward classes** ("data / shards / blueprint fragments / artifact cores")
   **become exactly four catalog items** — the smallest closed set covering the documented classes; more variants
   are additive later. Two classes already had exact catalog matches seeded in 0039 and reserved by
   ACTIVITIES.md §5 for precisely these later progression drops — `blueprint_fragment` (progression, rare) and
   `artifact_core` (progression, epic) — so they are **REUSED, not re-added** (re-adding them under
   exploration-specific ids would duplicate catalog concepts — forbidden). Only the two missing classes are
   seeded: **`scan_data`** ('Scan Data', category `data`, common — the bulk "data" class; the category value is
   the class name the ACTIVITIES.md row uses; `category` is unconstrained Reference/Config metadata with no code
   consumer, grep-verified) and **`anomaly_shard`** ('Anomaly Shard', `material`, uncommon — the "shards" class,
   named from the exploration ownership row's "anomalies"; deliberately NOT `captain_memory_shard`, which is
   captain-progression material, a different concept). Exploration reward set =
   `{ scan_data, anomaly_shard, blueprint_fragment, artifact_core }`.
3. **Capability flag `exploration_enabled = 'false'`** — the standard server-authoritative dark gate, copying the
   0070/0071 reject-before-any-read idiom verbatim (same posture as `trade_market_enabled`/`trade_relief_enabled`).
   No RPC exists yet; the flag simply exists dark. The migration header states the law: every exploration RPC
   added in later slices MUST check it FIRST and reject-before-any-read while false — UI hiding is never the only
   control.

**Work done** — one new migration `20260618000097_exploration_p11_catalog_and_flag.sql` (head bump **0096 → 0097**):
two idempotent `item_types` rows + one idempotent `game_config` row, both via the established
`on conflict … do nothing` seeding idiom (0039 / 0070). No table, no function, no RPC, no frontend, no index —
nothing else.

**RLS/grants — verified, not assumed.** New `item_types` rows inherit the table-wide public-read posture
(`item_types_public_read` for select using (true) + `grant select to anon, authenticated`, `0039:23–25`); the
`game_config` row likewise (`game_config_public_read`, `0003:13–15`). The items are inert without any exploration
RPC. No function created → no execute-surface relock needed (0054 precedent). Also grep-verified: `item_types` is
seeded ONLY in 0039 (no later migration adds items or a category constraint), and `0041` produces only
0039-seeded ids — so nothing can mint the new items yet; no loot source references them.

**Flag seeded false, nothing client-reachable, no behavior change.** No flag set true anywhere; no existing flag
value touched. `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` NOT edited — verified it enumerates dark gates only inline within
per-system rows (Trade Market / Main Ship), and no Exploration system row exists yet (it arrives with the
exploration tables in a later slice, which will add the matrix row + gate in the same step); `item_types` /
`game_config` ownership (Reference/Config, §1) is unchanged by adding rows. `docs/ACTIVITIES.md` untouched.
`main` untouched; migration head is now **0097**; `0001–0096` unedited.
`npm run build` green; `verify:m3`/`verify:m4` fail only on `fetch failed` (no reachable Supabase from this
sandbox) and `verify:m45` needs `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — the recorded environmental posture; no
code/assertion failure.

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none — additive Reference/Config seed + dark flag; no writer, no reader, no behavior.)_

## 2026-07-04 — EXPLORATION-P11 SLICE A: activity-agnostic deposit-on-arrival carrier (`reward_source_type`; refactor only, combat behavior unchanged, everything dark)

**Request.** Prerequisite refactor for Phase 11 Exploration: make the pending-bundle → attach →
deposit-on-arrival carrier activity-agnostic. No new feature, no behavior change, nothing activated.

**Design decision (self-approved).** `reward_grant(source_type, …)` has been generic since 0015/0040 — the only
combat coupling in the engine path (docs/ACTIVITIES.md §2) was at the CARRIER layer: `fleet_movements` had no
source-type column and `process_fleet_movements`' return branch (latest shipped body: `0030:36`) hard-coded
`reward_grant('combat', …)`. **Why:** Exploration (and later Mining) must reuse the exact same
pending-bundle → `movement_attach_cargo` → deposit-on-arrival path — one shared engine carrier, never a parallel
deposit system — so the movement row now transports its reward source type instead of the engine assuming combat.

**Work done** — one new migration `20260618000096_engine_reward_source_type.sql` (head bump **0095 → 0096**):
- **`fleet_movements.reward_source_type`** — `text not null default 'combat'` (existing rows backfill to
  `'combat'`: every payload-carrying return in flight today IS combat's) + closed domain CHECK
  `('combat','exploration','mining','trade')` matching the docs/ACTIVITIES.md §3 activity ownership table
  (closed set now; a future activity is an additive constraint change in a new forward-only migration).
- **`movement_attach_cargo(movement, source, bundle, source_type default 'combat')`** — the old 3-arg signature
  is DROPPED first (the 0038/0081–0084 signature-evolution idiom; keeping both overloads would make existing
  3-arg calls ambiguous), then re-created with the defaulted 4th param that writes the column. Every existing
  caller — `process_combat_ticks`, latest `0046:185`, a 3-arg call bound by name at runtime — keeps working
  verbatim via the default; combat callers are untouched.
- **`process_fleet_movements`** — re-created from its latest shipped body (`0030:36`, grep-confirmed: no later
  migration re-defines it or `movement_attach_cargo`; `0032/0041/0046` only re-define the CALLER
  `process_combat_ticks`) **byte-identical except** the deposit call — `reward_grant(m.reward_source_type, …)`
  instead of the literal `'combat'` — and that call's two-line comment, which claimed combat-specificity and
  would otherwise contradict the code it annotates.
- **ACL preserved (anti-cheat; no new client execute grants):** the re-created 4-arg `movement_attach_cargo`
  gets the explicit internal revoke (`from public, anon, authenticated` — 0093 idiom; the DROP discarded the old
  signature's ACL); `process_fleet_movements` keeps its ACL through CREATE OR REPLACE with a defense-in-depth
  re-assert (0070 idiom). Neither had — nor gains — any client or service_role grant (grep: no `src/`, no
  client RPC, no verify-runner grant; cron + SECURITY DEFINER orchestrators invoke them as owner).

**Combat behavior unchanged.** Same column default, same attach default, same deposit semantics and timing law
(pending while out, secured once on home arrival, forfeited on destruction), same idempotency
(`reward_grants UNIQUE (source_type, source_id)`, 0040). No flag added, read, or flipped; no activity enabled;
exploration remains entirely unbuilt/dark after this slice.

**State.** Forward-only. Migration `0096` is now the highest-numbered file; `0001–0095` unedited.
`docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` synced in the SAME step: the Movement row now names `movement_attach_cargo(…,
source_type='combat')` as the internal shared carrier, and the §3 return-arrival edge now reads
`Reward.grant(reward_source_type, bundle)` (activity-agnostic; today always `'combat'`). Sole writers unchanged:
Movement remains the sole `fleet_movements` writer (`movement_attach_cargo` is Movement-owned;
`process_fleet_movements` remains the only return-branch writer) and `reward_grant` remains the only depositor —
no new cross-system edge, call graph unchanged and acyclic. `docs/ACTIVITIES.md` untouched (it already describes
this target state). `main` untouched; no frontend, no workflow, no verifier change.
`npm run build` green (`tsc -b && vite build`, 141 modules); `verify:m3`/`verify:m4` fail only on
`fetch failed` (no reachable Supabase from this sandbox) and `verify:m45` needs `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` —
the same environmental posture recorded by the 2026-07-03 entries; no code/assertion failure.

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none — pure carrier refactor; the deposit path's combat literal was a latent Phase-11 blocker, removed
  before any exploration code exists.)_

## 2026-07-03 — Trade-economy cleanup audit: ROADMAP Phase-10 doc-sync (docs-only; one stale figure fixed)

**Request.** Final auto-cleanup/audit pass for the trade-economy milestone: verify the branch is in the clean
end-state the milestone claims (boundaries doc, single docked-location helper, dark-both-sides flags, CI proof
wiring, law-doc sync) and fix — narrowly — anything that is not.

**Audit result** (full evidence trail in the untracked scratch file `TRADE_ECONOMY_CLEANUP_RECON.local.md`):
claims (a)–(d) — SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES coverage + sole-writers/acyclicity, single `mainship_resolve_docked_location`
(defined once in `0092`, no surviving inline copy in `0093–0095` or the proof SQL), dark both sides
(`trade_market_enabled`/`trade_relief_enabled` seeded false + RPC dark-rejects + `TRADE_MARKET_ENABLED=false`
client gate; relief has NO client UI — N/A by evidence), and the `trade-v1-proof.yml` posture (feature-branch
triggers only, no `environment:`, `permissions: contents: read`, `if: always()` teardown, proof SQL one
begin…ROLLBACK txn, no COMMIT) — all ✅ CLEAN. ONE defect: claim (e) — `docs/ROADMAP.md` (Phase-10 cell, line 85)
still said "migration head `0092`" and omitted the economy-bootstrap phase entirely, contradicting this log's own
"migration head remains **0095**" (CI-wiring entry below).

**Work done** — exactly one doc-sync edit to the Phase-10 status sentence in `docs/ROADMAP.md`, nothing else:
- Stale "migration head `0092`" → "`0095`".
- The pipeline enumeration now includes the previously-missing 2026-07-03 work: cleanup helper `0092`,
  ECONOMY-BOOTSTRAP `0093–0095` (seed capital via `wallet_ensure` + no-softlock relief `market_claim_relief`),
  and the disposable proof `scripts/trade-economy-bootstrap-proof.{sql,sh}` wired into `trade-v1-proof.yml`.
  The historical `0073–0084` / `0085–0091` ranges and the "implemented DARK & PR-ready … all trade flags/gates
  OFF" meaning are unchanged.

**State.** Docs-only, forward-only. No code, migration, RPC, frontend, workflow, proof, flag default, or behavior
changed — nothing activated; `main` untouched; migration head remains **0095** on `autopilot/20260703-064048`.
No `SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` change (no architectural fact changed; §1/§2 already document the 0092–0095 surface —
re-verified in this audit). `npm run build` green (`tsc -b && vite build`, 141 modules); the remote-DB
`verify:m2/m3/m4` runs fail only on `fetch failed` (no reachable Supabase from this sandbox) and `verify:m45/m5`
need `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — environmental, no code/assertion failure;
`scripts/trade-economy-bootstrap-proof.sh selftest` passes in-sandbox.

**Bugs / fixes**
- **ROADMAP Phase-10 status stale (doc/law mismatch).** The 0093–0095 + proof + CI slices updated this log but
  not the ROADMAP status figure written back at head-0092 time. Fixed by the doc-sync above; no other
  contradiction found.

## 2026-07-03 — TRADE-ECONOMY-BOOTSTRAP proof wired into existing `trade-v1-proof.yml` (disposable-only; no new workflow)

**Request.** Wire the economy-bootstrap proof into CI by EXTENDING the existing `trade-v1-proof.yml` — which
already spins up ONE disposable stack for all Trading-V1 proofs — rather than adding a parallel workflow that would
redundantly start a second throwaway stack. This resolves the "CI wiring is a separate follow-up" note from the
prior entry.

**Work done** — additive edits to `.github/workflows/trade-v1-proof.yml` only (no new workflow file):
- **`selftest` job** — added a third step `- run: bash scripts/trade-economy-bootstrap-proof.sh selftest` after the
  trade-market-1 selftest (DB-free static check).
- **`disposable-matrix` job** — added a `TRADE-ECONOMY-BOOTSTRAP real-chain matrix` step mirroring the
  trade-market-1 step's exact shape (`set -a; . /tmp/sbenv; set +a; bash scripts/trade-economy-bootstrap-proof.sh
  local`), placed AFTER the trade-market-1 matrix and BEFORE the `if: always()` "Stop disposable stack" teardown so
  the single throwaway stack is still up when it runs. The new proof is self-rolling-back and order-independent;
  ordering just keeps the file readable.
- **Truthful references** — the `supabase start` step name "applies migrations 0001..0092" → "0001..0095"; the
  top-of-file comment + workflow `name:` now enumerate the economy-bootstrap proof (seed capital + no-softlock
  relief floor, 0093..0095) alongside the existing two, keeping the "NEVER production / no `environment:` / flips no
  committed flag / disposable local Supabase only" language intact.

**Preserved:** `permissions: contents: read`, the `concurrency` block, the `on:` triggers (feature branches only —
NOT `main`/any release branch), no `environment:` on any job, and the `if: always()` teardown. Reuses the single
disposable stack — no second stack started.

**State.** CI-config only. No migration, no `src/`, no committed flag changed; dispatches no production/deploy/
verifier/sensitive workflow (dispatching this workflow is a human/CI action, not taken here). No
`SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` change — a CI workflow is not an architectural fact. `main` untouched; migration head remains
**0095**. `selftest` re-run in-sandbox (DB-free) and passes; the `disposable-matrix` job needs GitHub-hosted
Docker/Supabase (same limitation as the sibling matrix) and was not run here.

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none — additive CI wiring; runs existing disposable proofs, changes no product code.)_

## 2026-07-03 — TRADE-ECONOMY-BOOTSTRAP proof: disposable, self-rolling-back seed + relief exercise (no CI yet)

**Request.** Add a disposable proof that actually exercises the seed-capital + no-softlock-relief SQL end-to-end —
the only way this logic runs, since `verify:m*` can't reach a live DB in-sandbox. Mirror the
`trade-market-1-proof.{sh,sql}` idiom. Touch no `src/` and no migrations.

**Work done** — two new files under `scripts/` (no migration, no committed flag change):
- **`trade-economy-bootstrap-proof.sql`** — one `begin;`…`rollback;` transaction that persists NOTHING (no COMMIT
  anywhere). Same idiom as the sibling: `\set ON_ERROR_STOP on`, the `pg_temp.call_as(sub, fn)` JWT-subject helper,
  a `teb` temp fixture table, `teb.`-prefixed fixture users, the "mirror production config a fresh chain lacks"
  setup (`reveal_starter_ports()` + transient `mainship_space_movement_enabled='true'`), real-RPC provisioning
  (`commission_first_main_ship()`), and owner-level `insert into public.player_wallet (player_id, balance)` /
  `insert into public.ship_cargo_lots …` for state setup (harness runs as DB owner, bypassing RLS; all reverted by
  ROLLBACK). Both dark flags (`trade_market_enabled`, `trade_relief_enabled`) are toggled ONLY inside the txn.
  Asserts, each ending in a `raise notice` PASS marker:
  - **SEED**: `SEED_PASS_DARK` (wallet-less buy while trade dark → `trade_market_disabled`, no wallet seeded),
    `SEED_PASS_APPLIED` (first buy seeds `starting_credits`=1000 once then debits → balance 1000−T),
    `SEED_PASS_ONCE` (2nd buy debits further; balance never returns to 1000 — `wallet_ensure`'s `on conflict do
    nothing` is unfarmable).
  - **RELIEF anti-farm matrix**: `RELIEF_PASS_DARK` (rock-bottom claim while relief dark → `trade_relief_disabled`,
    no claim, wallet 0), `RELIEF_PASS_NO_WALLET` (wallet-less → `no_wallet`, still no wallet — proves relief never
    calls `wallet_ensure`, closing the seed+relief double-grant hole), `RELIEF_PASS_WALLET_NOT_EMPTY`,
    `RELIEF_PASS_CARGO_NOT_EMPTY`, `RELIEF_PASS_GRANT` (0 → `relief_credits`=250, exactly one claim @ 250),
    `RELIEF_PASS_IDEMPOTENT` (replay → `idempotent_replay`, no 2nd claim/credit), `RELIEF_PASS_COOLDOWN`
    (`relief_cooldown_active` + `next_eligible_at`), `RELIEF_PASS_CAP` (cooldown transiently 0; 3 grants then 4th →
    `relief_cap_reached`). Ends with the `TRADE-ECONOMY-BOOTSTRAP PROOF PASSED` line, then `rollback;`.
- **`trade-economy-bootstrap-proof.sh`** — mirrors the sibling's two modes. `selftest` (DB-free): verifies the
  `.sql` is self-rolling-back (opens a txn, last verb is `rollback;`, no COMMIT), toggles both dark flags strictly
  inside the txn, provisions via the real RPCs (`commission_first_main_ship`/`market_buy`/`market_claim_relief`),
  sets up a wallet via an owner insert, contains every PASS marker, asserts the key reason tokens
  (`trade_market_disabled`/`trade_relief_disabled`/`no_wallet`/`wallet_not_empty`/`cargo_not_empty`/
  `idempotent_replay`/`relief_cooldown_active`/`relief_cap_reached`), and references neither `src/` nor
  `migrations/`; prints an ALL-PASSED line. `local` (against a disposable `DB_URL`): `psql -X -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1
  -f` the `.sql`, require the final PASS line + every marker, print `OVERALL_PASS`.

**Self-rolling-back; persists nothing; flips no committed flag.** The whole proof runs inside one rolled-back
transaction — no wallet, lot, claim, ship, fixture user, or flag flip survives. The dark flags are enabled only
transiently inside the txn to exercise the capabilities; production/committed defaults stay false. Relief credits
are never injected directly — the GRANT case drives the real `market_claim_relief` RPC.

**State.** No migration added/edited; no `src/`; no committed flag changed. **CI wiring is a separate follow-up**
(would mirror the existing `trade-*-proof` CI idiom). No `SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` change — a proof script is not an
architectural fact. `main` untouched. `selftest` was run in-sandbox (DB-free) and passes; `local` needs a
disposable Supabase (same environmental limitation as `verify:m*`) and was not run here.

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none — new disposable proof; exercises existing DARK logic, changes no product code.)_

## 2026-07-03 — TRADE-MARKET-1 no-softlock floor: relief claim RPC `market_claim_relief` (DARK; server-rejected)

**Request.** The relief floor's writer: a Trade-Market orchestrator that grants `relief_credits` to a genuinely
softlocked player and records the claim. Forward-only; ships DARK; no flag flipped true.

**Work done** — one new migration `20260618000095_trade_market_1_claim_relief.sql` (head bump **0094 → 0095**):
`public.market_claim_relief(p_request_id uuid) returns jsonb` (`plpgsql` / `security definer` / `search_path =
public`; market_buy idiom + ACL: `revoke … from public, anon; grant … to authenticated`). It is the **sole writer**
of `trade_relief_claims`. Ordered body: (1) `auth.uid()` → not_authenticated; (2) **DARK reject before any read**
`if not cfg_bool('trade_relief_enabled')` → trade_relief_disabled; (3) `p_request_id is null` → invalid_request;
(4) **account lock + rock-bottom read** `select balance … for update` on the EXISTING wallet row, NOT FOUND →
no_wallet; (5) idempotency on (player, request_id) → verbatim replay, no re-grant; (6) `balance <> 0` →
wallet_not_empty; (7) cargo sum across ALL the player's ships (`ship_cargo_lots ⋈ main_ship_instances`) `<> 0` →
cargo_not_empty; (8) lifetime cap `count >= cfg_num('relief_max_lifetime_claims')` → relief_cap_reached;
(9) cooldown `last > now() - cfg_num('relief_cooldown_seconds')` → relief_cooldown_active (+ next_eligible_at);
(10) grant `cfg_num('relief_credits')` **through `wallet_credit`**; (11) insert the claim, return
{ok, claim_id, amount, claimed_at}.

**Anti-farm design (the "no `wallet_ensure` in relief" rule).** `wallet_credit` now routes through `wallet_ensure`,
which seeds `starting_credits` (1000). If relief ensured a wallet, a rock-bottom player with NO wallet row would be
seeded 1000 **plus** granted 250 relief — a farming hole. So relief **requires an EXISTING `player_wallet` row**
(reason `no_wallet` when absent) and **never calls `wallet_ensure`**: a player with no row hasn't entered the
economy and gets the normal seed on first trade, not relief. The rock-bottom read is `SELECT balance … FOR UPDATE`
on that existing row, giving a natural **per-account lock** — every check and the ledger write run under it, so
distinct-`request_id` races cannot bypass the cap/cooldown. Relief fires only at exact rock-bottom (balance = 0 AND
zero cargo across all ships), bounded by the lifetime cap and cooldown.

**Boundaries.** Trade Market is the sole `trade_relief_claims` writer; the balance write flows only through
`wallet_credit`, preserving `player_wallet`'s sole-writer invariant. All of `player_wallet` (FOR UPDATE),
`ship_cargo_lots`, `main_ship_instances` are DOWNWARD reads — no new cross-system edge, no cycle, Wallet stays a
downward leaf.

**State.** Forward-only. Migration `0095` is the highest-numbered file; `0001–0094` unedited. Ships
**DARK/server-rejected** (`trade_relief_enabled=false`) — no flag default flipped. `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`
synced in the SAME step (Trade Market row names `market_claim_relief` as sole `trade_relief_claims` writer +
records the downward reads; acyclic-invariant note updated). `main` untouched. No frontend, no workflow, no
verifier, no engine (M2/M3/M4/M4.5) change.

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none — additive DARK RPC; the seed+relief double-grant hole is closed by design via the existing-wallet-row
  requirement, not patched after the fact.)_

## 2026-07-03 — TRADE-MARKET-1 no-softlock floor: relief ledger + tunables + dark flag (schema slice; NO RPC)

**Request.** Schema/config/flag slice of the no-softlock relief floor: add the relief ledger table, its tunables,
and a dark gate — no RPC and no writer yet. Forward-only; ships DARK; no flag flipped true.

**Ownership decision (planner authority).** The relief ledger + orchestrator belong to **Trade Market**, not
Wallet (overriding the scope-lock's tentative "Wallet-owned ledger" phrasing — table ownership is a design detail
within scope). Trade Market is the economy orchestrator that ALREADY fans out downward to Wallet (credit), Trade
Cargo (lots), and Main Ship (read); siting relief there introduces **zero new cross-system edges** and keeps Wallet
a pure downward leaf. Making Wallet orchestrate relief would force Wallet to read Trade Cargo + Main Ship and stop
being a leaf. Mirrors the existing `trade_receipts` table + `market_buy`/`market_sell` RPCs. The relief credit is
granted THROUGH `wallet_credit`, so Wallet stays the sole `player_wallet` writer — Trade Market never writes
`player_wallet` directly.

**Work done** — one new migration `20260618000094_trade_market_1_relief_claims.sql` (head bump **0093 → 0094**):
- **`public.trade_relief_claims`** — Trade-Market-owned, per-player idempotent relief ledger: `claim_id` (pk),
  `player_id` (fk → auth.users, on delete cascade), `request_id`, `amount` (`check >= 0`), `claimed_at`,
  `unique (player_id, request_id)` idempotency key, and a `(player_id, claimed_at)` index for the cooldown /
  lifetime-cap lookups the RPC will do. RLS enabled; owner-read policy `player_id = auth.uid()`; `grant select` to
  authenticated (NOT anon); **no** insert/update/delete policy and **no** write grant → Trade Market will be the
  sole writer via the forthcoming SECURITY DEFINER RPC. Account-scoped (keyed by player_id, not ship) because
  relief is account-level softlock recovery; RLS/comment idiom matches `trade_receipts` (0086).
- **Three tunables** (placeholders) via `on conflict (key) do nothing`: `relief_credits`=`250` (grant per claim),
  `relief_cooldown_seconds`=`86400` (24h minimum spacing — prevents rapid re-farming),
  `relief_max_lifetime_claims`=`3` (lifetime cap per player — bounds total relief while still guaranteeing
  genuine-softlock recovery).
- **Dark flag** `trade_relief_enabled`=`'false'` via `on conflict (key) do nothing`. The relief RPC (next step) is
  server-rejected until this flips; it stays false here — no flag set true.

**No writer exists yet.** The table starts DARK with no writer — exactly as `player_wallet`/`trade_receipts` did in
0086. Nothing reads or writes `trade_relief_claims` yet; the sole writer arrives with the relief RPC in the next
slice, itself gated by `trade_relief_enabled=false`.

**State.** Forward-only. Migration `0094` is the highest-numbered file; `0001–0093` unedited. No new cross-system
edge, no cycle — Wallet remains a downward leaf and `player_wallet`'s sole-writer invariant is preserved (relief
credits flow through `wallet_credit`). `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` synced in the SAME step (ownership matrix +
Trade Market section + acyclic-invariant note). `main` untouched. No frontend, no workflow, no verifier, no engine
(M2/M3/M4/M4.5) change. No flag default flipped true.

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none — additive schema/config/flag slice; no writer, no behavior change.)_

## 2026-07-03 — TRADE-MARKET-1 seed capital: `starting_credits` tunable + single shared `wallet_ensure` (DARK)

**Request.** Seed-capital slice of the Trading V1 economy bootstrap: add a `starting_credits` tunable seeded into a
wallet on first creation, and collapse the two copies of the Wallet "lazy ensure" block (inline in `wallet_debit`
0089 and `wallet_credit` 0090) into ONE shared helper. Forward-only; ships DARK; no flag default flipped.

**Work done** — one new migration `20260618000093_trade_market_1_wallet_seed_capital.sql` (head bump **0092 → 0093**):
- **`starting_credits` = `'1000'`** added to `game_config` via the `on conflict (key) do nothing` numeric-seed idiom
  (0003). Placeholder economy value; an inert tunable until a wallet is actually created.
- **`wallet_ensure(player)`** — the ONE shared lazy-ensure + seed:
  `insert into public.player_wallet (player_id, balance) values (p_player, coalesce(cfg_num('starting_credits'),0)::numeric) on conflict (player_id) do nothing`.
  Seeds the starting balance exactly once on first creation; idempotent + **unfarmable** by the `player_id`
  primary-key conflict (a re-call is a no-op — the row is only ever inserted once). Internal (`revoke execute …
  from public, anon, authenticated`), `security definer`, `set search_path = public`.
- **`wallet_debit` de-duplicated:** former inline `insert … on conflict do nothing` → `perform wallet_ensure(...)`;
  the existing atomic conditional `update … where balance >= p_amount` and `return found` are left exactly as-is.
  Behavior preserved: seed on first touch, then race-safe conditional debit that can never overdraw.
- **`wallet_credit` de-duplicated:** reworked from its upsert-add into **ensure-then-add** — `perform
  wallet_ensure(...)` then an unconditional `update … set balance = balance + p_amount`. The ensure guarantees the
  row exists (seeded on first creation), then the amount adds on top — credit semantics preserved, second copy of
  the ensure logic removed. This is the de-duplication target: the ensure block now lives in exactly one place.

**Ships DARK — no flag flipped.** The seed only ever fires when a wallet is first created, and every
wallet-creation path is already server-rejected: `market_buy`/`market_sell` under `trade_market_enabled=false`, and
the additional-ship commission debit under `mainship_additional_commission_enabled=false`. So no wallet — and thus
no seed — occurs while trade/commission stay dark. No flag default changed.

**State.** Forward-only. Migration `0093` is now the highest-numbered file; `0001–0092` unedited. Wallet stays a
**downward leaf** (reads `cfg_num('starting_credits')` from Reference/Config — a DOWNWARD read; no new cycle, no new
writer to any non-Wallet table). `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` Wallet row synced in the SAME step (names
`wallet_ensure` as the shared lazy-ensure+seed, records the config read, drops the stale `wallet_credit` "lazy
ensure" phrasing). `main` untouched. No frontend, no workflow, no verifier, no engine (M2/M3/M4/M4.5) change.

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none — clean de-duplication + additive tunable; behavior preserved on both wallet writers.)_

---

## 2026-07-03 — Docs-only roadmap reconciliation: Phase-10 label + live migration head (no code/flag change)

**Request.** Reconcile the Phase-10 (row `10 ⏳`) cell in `docs/ROADMAP.md` (line 85) with its own appended
status: replace the stale leading label `**designed, NOT built.**` and bump the stale live "migration head"
figure. Docs-only; touch nothing else.

**Work done** — exactly two edits to the Phase-10 cell, nothing else in it:
- **Label `designed, NOT built` → `implemented DARK, NOT activated`.** The cell's own appended note already reads
  "**implemented DARK & PR-ready** … all trade flags/gates OFF", so the leading "NOT built" clause was factually
  wrong (the pipeline IS built, only un-activated). The new label preserves the "not live" meaning while removing
  the contradiction.
- **Live "migration head `0091`" → "migration head `0092`".** The docked-location-helper migration
  `20260618000092_trade_market_1_resolve_docked_location.sql` was added after that status note was written, so the
  live head figure was stale. The historical `TRADE-MARKET-1 `0085–0091`` range is **left untouched** — it
  correctly describes TRADE-MARKET-1's original migration set; `0092` is the later cleanup helper and only the live
  head figure was stale.

**State.** Docs-only, forward-only. No code, migration, RPC, frontend, workflow, test, verifier, flag default, or
behavior changed — nothing activated. Locked scope was `docs/ROADMAP.md` + this `docs/DEV_LOG.md` entry only. No
`SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` sync needed (no architectural fact changed — no table/writer/constraint/call-graph change).
Migration head remains **0092** on `autopilot/20260703-064048`; `main` untouched. No build/test run is required
(no runtime surface); the M2/M3/M4/M4.5 engine tests are unaffected.

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none — docs reconciliation only.)_

## 2026-07-03 — Trading V1 cleanup: CI proof workflow `trade-v1-proof.yml` (disposable DB only; no production)

**Request.** Wire the two already-existing Trading-V1 proofs into CI. Add ONE workflow that runs both against a
throwaway/disposable Supabase only — never production, flipping no flag. Reuse the `port-entry-1-proof.yml` idiom.

**Work done**
- **New workflow `.github/workflows/trade-v1-proof.yml`** (modeled on `port-entry-1-proof.yml`). One workflow, one
  disposable stack for both proofs:
  - `selftest` job — DB-free static checks: `bash scripts/trade-fleet-0c-proof.sh selftest` +
    `bash scripts/trade-market-1-proof.sh selftest`.
  - `disposable-matrix` job — `supabase start` (applies the full local chain 0001..0092, incl. the new shared
    docked-location helper), exports the disposable `DB_URL` via `supabase status -o env` into a tmp env file (no
    secrets), then runs `trade-fleet-0c-proof.sh local` then `trade-market-1-proof.sh local`, and an
    `if: always()` `supabase stop --no-backup || true`.
  - `on: workflow_dispatch` + `push` to `autopilot/**`, `trade-**`, `trade-market-**`, `trade-fleet-**` — **not**
    `main` / any release branch. `permissions: contents: read`; `concurrency` on `github.ref` with
    `cancel-in-progress: true`. **No `environment:` on any job** → no job can read production secrets.
- **Flips NO committed flag.** Both proofs are self-rolling-back: they enable the dark trade capabilities ONLY
  inside a txn that ends in ROLLBACK (no COMMIT), so the committed flag defaults (`trade_market_enabled`,
  `mainship_additional_commission_enabled` = false) are untouched. Disposable local Supabase only — never prod.

**State.** Additive CI wiring only. No proof `.sql`/`.sh`, migration, flag default, `MarketPanel`, or boundary-doc
change (a CI workflow is not an architectural fact, so `SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` needs none). Migration head unchanged
at **0092**. Not dispatched/triggered (a human/CI action); `main` untouched. Both `selftest` invocations pass
locally (DB-free); the `disposable-matrix` job needs GitHub-hosted Docker/Supabase and was **not** run in-sandbox.

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none — additive CI wiring around existing proofs.)_

## 2026-07-03 — Trading V1 cleanup: extract shared docked-location helper (migration 0092; behavior-identical)

**Request.** The identical ~10-line "resolve docked location" block was copy-pasted verbatim into
`get_market_offers` (0087), `market_buy` (0089), and `market_sell` (0090). Extract ONE shared helper and repoint
the three RPCs, in a NEW forward-only migration — never editing 0087/0089/0090; behavior-identical; DARK.

**Work done**
- **New migration `20260618000092_trade_market_1_resolve_docked_location.sql`.** Adds
  `public.mainship_resolve_docked_location(uuid) returns uuid` (`security definer`, `set search_path`, `stable`,
  read-only): calls `mainship_space_validate_context`, requires `ok` + `state='at_location'`, then reads the
  present/location fleet's `current_location_id` — returns that id or NULL. Both original "not docked" null paths
  collapse to one NULL, which each caller maps to the same `{ok:false, reason:'not_docked'}` → behavior-identical.
- **Repointed all three RPCs** via `create or replace` (supersedes 0087/0089/0090 forward-only; those files are
  untouched). Each body is byte-for-byte its original except (a) the inline block → the helper call, and (b) the
  now-unused `v_ctx jsonb;` local dropped (dead after extraction). Flag gate, `mainship_resolve_owned_ship`
  ownership assert, per-ship lock, request-id idempotency, offer/volume/cargo checks, and all wallet/cargo/receipt
  writes are unchanged.
- **ACL — INTERNAL (deviation from the step's suggested `grant authenticated`, on security grounds).** The helper
  is revoked from public/anon/authenticated (no client grant), matching its true siblings
  `mainship_space_validate_context` / `mainship_resolve_owned_ship`. It does NOT assert ownership (the
  orchestrators do, before calling it); granting it to `authenticated` would create a new client-callable
  SECURITY DEFINER read that leaks any ship's dock. It is called only inside the SECURITY DEFINER trade RPCs
  (which run as owner), so the internal ACL changes no call path.
- **Law-doc sync (same step).** `SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`: named the helper in the Main Ship §2 row (shared
  read-only docked-location helper, internal, called DOWNWARD by Trade Market) and in the Trade Market row's
  docked-context read; extended the acyclic-fan-out note with the (pre-existing) Trade Market → Main-Ship-read
  edge, now a single named function.

**State.** Migration head now **0092**. No flag/behavior change; feature stays **DARK** (`trade_market_enabled`,
`TRADE_MARKET_ENABLED`, `mainship_additional_commission_enabled`, `MAINSHIP_ADDITIONAL_ENABLED` all OFF). No
migration ≤ 0091 edited; `main` untouched; not applied to production.

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none — pure de-duplication; three verbatim copies → one helper, behavior-identical.)_

---

## 2026-07-03 — Trading V1 cleanup pass: SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES doc-sync (docs-only; no behavior/flag change)

**Request.** Bring `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` back in sync with the actual schema after the TRADE-FLEET-0C /
TRADE-MARKET-1 migrations (0073–0091). Docs-only; touch no code, migration, RPC, workflow, or flag.

**Work done**
- **Corrected the stale one-ship-per-player claim.** §4 item 7 (and the §2 Main Ship row) asserted
  `main_ship_instances` had one row per player via a `player_id` UNIQUE. That UNIQUE
  (`main_ship_instances_player_id_key`) was **dropped in migration 0079** — a player MAY now own multiple ships.
  Both spots now state multi-ship is structurally allowed but stays **DARK**: sole-ship is a runtime shim / dark
  gate (`mainship_additional_commission_enabled=false`), not a schema constraint.
- **Documented the four new tables in the §1 ownership matrix** with their real sole-writers:
  `trade_goods` = **Reference/Config** (Trade Market static catalog; admin/migration, seed-only),
  `ship_cargo_lots` = **Trade Cargo**, `player_wallet` = **Wallet**, `trade_receipts` = **Trade Market**.
- **Added the three new systems to the §2 contract:** **Wallet** (downward leaf; `wallet_debit`/`wallet_credit`
  — both Main Ship (add-ship `main_ship_price` debit) and Trade Market (buy debit / sell credit) depend DOWNWARD
  on it, Wallet depends on nothing above → acyclic, no mutual dependency); **Trade Cargo**
  (`trade_cargo_add_lot`/`trade_cargo_consume` — per-ship volume-keyed lots; a leaf Trade Market depends on);
  **Trade Market** (`trade_receipts`; orchestrates buy/sell fanning out DOWNWARD to Wallet + Trade Cargo,
  reads `trade_goods` + docked context; DARK while `trade_market_enabled=false`). Added an acyclic-fan-out note
  confirming exactly one sole-writer per table and no second writer anywhere.

**State.** Docs-only. **No** migration/RPC/`MarketPanel`/workflow/flag change; migration head unchanged at **0091**.
The trade feature stays **DARK** (`trade_market_enabled`, `TRADE_MARKET_ENABLED`,
`mainship_additional_commission_enabled`, `MAINSHIP_ADDITIONAL_ENABLED` all OFF); `main` untouched.

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none — a law-doc that contradicted the schema was corrected; no behavior path changed.)_

## 2026-07-03 — TRADE-UI-1 landed DARK + PR-ready (ship-switcher + buy/sell + §2.5 sole-ship shim retirement)

**Request.** Complete **TRADE-UI-1** on `autopilot/20260703-064048`: the client trading surface (ship switcher,
market buy/sell) and the **§2.5 sole-ship shim retirement** (the UI passes an explicit `p_main_ship_id`). Additive,
gated **OFF**, behavior-preserving; no migration/DB/verifier/workflow/flag change; `main` untouched.

**Work done**
- **Client trade surface (DARK).** Selected-ship model `useMainShipSelection` (owner-reads `main_ship_instances`,
  auto-selects the sole ship, N-ship-ready); `ShipSwitcher` (selection-only; a single ship renders as a
  non-interactive sole entry); `MarketPanel` read view (wallet, occupied cargo m³ vs capacity, station offers)
  **plus per-offer buy/sell** wired to `market_buy` / `market_sell` — each intentional click is one idempotent
  command keyed by a fresh `crypto.randomUUID()`, a **synchronous in-flight ref** guards against double-submit, and
  a success re-reads wallet/cargo/offers via `refresh()`. Fail-closed server reasons map through the pure
  `tradeReasonMessage`. Everything mounts only behind `TRADE_MARKET_ENABLED = false` and is **double fail-closed**
  against the server `trade_market_enabled` flag (also false — the trade RPCs reject before any ship read).
- **§2.5 sole-ship shim retirement.** The client now sends an explicit `p_main_ship_id` at ⑤ port
  move-to-location, ④ space-stop, ③ movement-readiness, ② dock-services, ① repair, and ⑦ normalize-dock. Each is
  behavior-preserving: with one ship the sourced id equals the shim-derived sole ship; a transitional `null` still
  resolves via the server `count = 1` shim; ownership is server-asserted, so an explicit id can only ever act on the
  caller's own ship. ⑥ `command_main_ship_space_move` is **deferred by design** — its RPC intentionally never took
  `p_main_ship_id` in TRADE-FLEET-0C (it rejects at the coordinate gate before any ship read).
- Delivered as six small, independently-reviewable commits (map hooks/panels; plus `dashboard/MainShipPanel.tsx`
  for repair and `portentry/` for normalize under a deliberately-widened frontend scope, id-threading only).

**State.** Migration head **unchanged at `0091`** — TRADE-UI-1 touched **no** migration/DB/verifier/workflow. The
feature is **DARK and PR-ready** on `autopilot/20260703-064048`: buildable, **not deployed, not verified in
production**. All trade / add-ship gates + flags remain **OFF**: `TRADE_MARKET_ENABLED`,
`MAINSHIP_ADDITIONAL_ENABLED`, `trade_market_enabled`, `mainship_additional_commission_enabled`,
`mainship_coordinate_travel_enabled`.

**Human-gated follow-ups (NOT done, by design)**
- **Activate trading:** flip `trade_market_enabled` + `TRADE_MARKET_ENABLED` (and, for the multi-ship add-ship
  path, `mainship_additional_commission_enabled` + `MAINSHIP_ADDITIONAL_ENABLED`).
- **Server-side removal of the sole-ship shim** — a future migration, only once the UI-explicit-id path is merged.
- **Run the rendered `.uispec.ts` suites in CI** — this sandbox lacks the browser binary (`chrome-headless-shell`).
- **Small `react-hooks` lint-debt cleanup** — documented pre-existing suppressions in `usePortEntry.ts` and
  `useDockServices.ts` (a `useState`-initializer refactor; out of scope for the id-threading commits).

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none — additive dark UI + behavior-preserving id threading; no production code path changed.)_

## 2026-07-03 — Repo/docs sync + PORT-ENTRY player UI landing recorded (no new build)

**Request.** Pull `main` current on the local machine and bring the project docs (log, guide, PDFs) up to date.

**Work done**
- Synced local `main` (fast-forward **22 commits → `f48bc53`**). No code written this session.
- Recorded that the **PORT-ENTRY player UI** (PR #65, `cb0d4fe`) is **merged** — the player-facing **Claim First
  Ship** + **Finish Docking (normalize)** panel (`src/features/portentry/PortEntryPanel.tsx` + hooks) now exists,
  **frontend-only**, calling the migration-`0072` RPCs; no new migration.
- Refreshed the guide **Current project snapshot** with a 2026-07-03 note (`main` head → `f48bc53`, PORT-ENTRY UI
  merged, Trading V1 FIXED to volume-only, TRADE-FLEET-0A audit recorded via PR #66).

**State.** Migration head **unchanged at `0072`**; coordinate travel stays **DARK**
(`mainship_coordinate_travel_enabled = false`). Next planned: **TRADE-FLEET-0B** (user-approved multi-ship +
volume-cargo contract — design/approval only). Trading V1 not started.

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none — docs/sync only; no code path touched.)_

## 2026-07-02 — Trading V1 design record — FIXED product direction (volume-only per-ship cargo + multi-ship foundation) + TRADE-FLEET-0A read-only audit (DESIGN RECORD ONLY; nothing built)

**Request.** Do **not** begin Trading implementation. Fix the Trading V1 product direction (below) as binding for
design, and produce **TRADE-FLEET-0A** — a strict read-only impact audit for introducing **multiple persistent main
ships** and **ship-bound, volume-based cargo**. No branch, PR, migration, code, seed, workflow, deployment, or
production-state change; PORT-ENTRY, coordinate-travel, flags, and movement are untouched
(`mainship_coordinate_travel_enabled` stays **false**). Migration head remains **`0072`**.

> **Supersession note.** This direction **replaces** the earlier same-day draft that used **kilograms + cubic
> metres (dual mass+volume caps)** and allowed **same-port ship-to-ship transfer**. The FIXED model is
> **volume-only (m³)**, and **cargo transfer between ships is OUT of Trading V1 scope.** Mass / density / fuel /
> acceleration / handling are **future-only**, not part of this foundation.

**Fixed direction (binding for design):**

1. **Multi-ship from the start.** Multiple persistent main ships are a **Trading foundation**, not a later
   module/captain feature. A player may eventually own and operate several main ships **concurrently** (one docked
   & trading while another travels or docks elsewhere).
2. **Cargo is ship-bound.** Trade cargo is physically assigned to **one** ship; it moves only when that ship moves;
   it is **never pooled** across a player's ships. **No** account-level trade inventory. **No** remote buy/sell and
   **no** cargo teleportation.
3. **Volume-only capacity (m³).** Canonical storage + validation unit is **cubic metres**. Player-facing display may
   use m³ (and litres for small amounts). **No** abstract cargo units. **No** kilograms / mass / density / dual
   mass+volume in Trading V1 (those are explicitly future-only).
4. **Commodities have a defined physical volume.** Trade denominations (crate / pallet / tank / container / bundle…)
   each resolve to a **fixed canonical m³**; the capacity rule is **occupied volume only**.
5. **Every market action targets one selected ship** — owned by the player, physically **docked** at the relevant
   port, in an eligible state; buy/sell operate only on **that ship's** cargo.
6. **Coordinate travel stays dark.** Existing **port-to-port** travel is sufficient for the first economy; no
   coordinate-travel activation, change, or dependency is recommended.
7. **Out of V1 scope:** pooled fleet cargo; account-level trade inventory; remote market actions; **cargo transfer
   between ships**; port warehouses; automated trade routes; player-to-player trading; dynamic supply/demand;
   cargo loss / piracy / insurance / destruction economics; mass / density / fuel / acceleration / handling.

**Implementation sequence (design-level; unchanged ordering, cargo model corrected to volume-only):**

```
PORT-ENTRY (complete, mig 0072)
  → TRADE-FLEET-0A  read-only impact audit (this entry — design record only)
  → TRADE-FLEET-0B  explicit user-approved multi-ship + volume-cargo contract (design/approval only)
  → TRADE-FLEET-0C  coherent implementation slice (multi-ship + ship-bound volume-only m³ cargo, one slice)
  → TRADE-MARKET-1  server-authoritative market (offers, wallet, atomic volume-checked buy/sell vs a selected ship)
  → TRADE-UI-1      selected-ship market + fleet interface
```

**TRADE-FLEET-0A audit (read-only).** The full impact audit — every current one-main-ship assumption
(DB / backend / frontend / verifier / onboarding) classified mandatory / compatibility-sensitive / optional /
not-affected; cargo-locality guarantees; a minimal design-level data boundary; multi-ship concurrency & safety;
compatibility/migration risks across all ship states; affected frontend surfaces; verifier implications; blockers;
open decisions; and a recommended slice order — is recorded in
[`docs/TRADE_FLEET_0A_IMPACT_AUDIT.md`](TRADE_FLEET_0A_IMPACT_AUDIT.md). Key finding: the locking/idempotency
substrate is **already ship-scoped** (`mainship_space_lock_context(main_ship_id)`, no advisory/player lock;
idempotency keyed `(main_ship_id, request_id)`); the only hard single-ship blockers are the
`main_ship_instances.player_id UNIQUE` constraint and the uniform `where player_id = v_player` ship derivation.

**Work done**
- DEV_LOG (this entry) + ROADMAP Phase 10 row and Standing Law #1 annotated with the FIXED (volume-only) direction.
- New read-only audit doc `docs/TRADE_FLEET_0A_IMPACT_AUDIT.md` (replaces the superseded kg+m³ draft audit).

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none — design record only; no code path touched)_

## 2026-06-30 — OSN-COORD-ENABLE (dark) → PORT-ENTRY-1 first-ship commission/normalize → production verifier (head `0070` → `0072`)

Since the entry below (head `0070`, OSN port-to-port live, coordinate travel server-disabled) the project built the
coordinate-travel capability **end-to-end and left it DARK**, then shipped the **first-ship / port-entry** backend
(the Trading prerequisite), then added a dedicated production verifier for it. **Net production change:** migration
head **`0070` → `0072`**; **no flag flipped** — `mainship_coordinate_travel_enabled` stays **false**, coordinate UI
hidden, raw coordinate command server-rejected, port-to-port unchanged/enabled. `main` head `a947c8d`.

**Work done (in order):**

- **OSN-COORD-ENABLE-1B (migration `0071`, PR #57, deployed DARK).** Extended the authenticated read-model
  `get_osn_movement_readiness()` with one additive boolean `coordinate_travel_available = osn_available AND
  cfg_bool('mainship_coordinate_travel_enabled')` — derived from the existing anchored-origin decision, false for
  every caller while the gate is false. Disposable 2×2 truth-table proof; gated deploy.
- **OSN-COORD-ENABLE-1B-VERIFY (PR #58).** Repinned the read-only post-enable verifier to head `0071` + a
  single-RPC readiness-capability contract probe. Production read-only run: `OVERALL_PASS=true`.
- **OSN-COORD-ENABLE-1C (PR #59, Pages-deployed).** The frontend empty-space coordinate UI is now driven SOLELY by
  the server-derived `coordinate_travel_available` (strict fail-closed parser + `isCoordinateTargetingActionable`);
  the compile-time `OSN_COORDINATE_TRAVEL_ENABLED` constant is retired as the UI authority. **Effect:** when the
  server flag is later flipped true, the coordinate UI lights up with no redeploy; until then it stays dark.
  Live bundle independently verified dark.
- **PORT-ENTRY-1 (migration `0072`, PR #61, deployed).** First-ship commissioning + same-location dock
  normalization — the Trading prerequisite. `port_entry_commission_writer(uuid)` (service-role-only) inserts a new
  player's ship DIRECTLY into canonical `at_location` at Haven Reach; `commission_first_main_ship()` (authenticated,
  zero-arg) outcome matrix A–F; `normalize_main_ship_dock()` (authenticated) upgrades a coherent `legacy_present`
  ship in place. Two-phase lock protocol; proven with a real two-session concurrency race (B blocks on the
  `player_id` unique conflict until A commits). Additive function-only; no flag/data/coordinate change. **No
  player-facing UI yet.**
- **PORT-ENTRY-1-VERIFY-1 (PR #62, merged — tooling only).** A dedicated, dispatch-only, production-gated
  read-only verifier proving production contains exactly the three PORT-ENTRY functions (signatures, bodies via raw
  `pg_proc.prosrc` md5, `SECURITY DEFINER`, `search_path`, ACLs) AND the **complete** authenticated client-RPC
  inventory (exact 20-RPC set by OID). Disposable proof passes + fails closed for 8 mutation cases. **Not yet run
  against production** (the gated run is the next human-approved checkpoint).

**Current authoritative state (HELD):** head `0072`; `mainship_send_enabled=true`, `mainship_space_movement_enabled=true`
(port-to-port enabled), `mainship_coordinate_travel_enabled=false`, `coordinate_travel_available=false`. Coordinate
travel and Trading V1 are **not** started; PORT-ENTRY player UI is the next active development.

---

## 2026-06-29 — OSN enabled → Phase 9 docked-port surface → coordinate-gate hardening → Phase 10 Trading design (head `0068` → `0070`)

Since the PORT-LAUNCH entry below (head `0068`, ports public, OSN still dark) the project advanced through OSN
enablement, a first player-facing port surface, a coordinate-travel security fix, and a full Trading V1 design
pass. **Net production change:** migration head **`0068` → `0070`**; **OSN port-to-port travel is now ENABLED**;
**free arbitrary-coordinate travel is server-disabled by default.** Current live flags: `mainship_send_enabled =
true`, `mainship_space_movement_enabled = true` (port-to-port ON), `OSN_COORDINATE_TRAVEL_ENABLED = false`
(frontend) + `mainship_coordinate_travel_enabled = false` (server, new in `0070`). `main` head `6e2a091`.

**Work done (in order):**

- **OSN enablement (config-only; head stays `0068`).** The dark OSN port-to-port path was turned on via the
  controlled one-shot enable operation (`mainship_space_movement_enabled` false→true), independently read-only
  verified against production, and a disposable authenticated port-to-port journey (depart → arrive → dock
  `at_location`) confirmed live behavior. A ship docked at a port can now travel port-to-port; arbitrary
  coordinate travel stayed off.

- **Phase 9 — docked-port read surface (PR #49 → migration `0069`, deployed).** `get_my_current_dock_services()`
  (authenticated, read-only, zero-arg, `SECURITY DEFINER`): derives player → own ship → validated dock, and
  ONLY for the `at_location` state returns the port + its ACTIVE `location_services` (today: Docking). Frontend
  `DockServicesPanel` shows "Main ship docked at &lt;port&gt;" + service chips only when docked. No buy/sell/market.
  Proven (disposable RPC matrix + rendered UI), deployed `0068`→`0069`, read-only verified live (`OVERALL_PASS=true`).

- **Phase 9 closeout (PR #50, frontend/tooling only — no migration).** Dock-context hardening (stale-data
  protection on a lifecycle change, safe-failure, mobile width cap), the one stale player-facing string fixed,
  and the current-state verifier `osn-postenable-verify` repinned head `0068`→`0069` + dock-surface ACL
  assertions; the historical pre-enable verifiers were left untouched.

- **OSN-COORD-GATE-1 (PR #51 → migration `0070`, deployed).** Closed a real gap: the public raw coordinate
  command `command_main_ship_space_move` was guarded only by `mainship_space_movement_enabled` (true for the
  enabled port-to-port path), while the "free coordinate travel OFF" control was **frontend-only** — so a direct
  authenticated API caller could request arbitrary coordinates. Fix: a server-owned key
  `mainship_coordinate_travel_enabled` (default **false**); the raw command now returns `coordinate_travel_disabled`
  BEFORE any ship read / lock / writer call (no side effect) while the key is false. The location-target command
  `command_main_ship_space_move_to_location` is **unchanged** (still governed by `mainship_space_movement_enabled`;
  port-to-port unaffected). Disposable matrix `ok[1..7]` green; deployed `0069`→`0070`. Gate ships **false**.

- **Phase 10 Trading V1 — design & calibration (DESIGN ONLY; nothing built).** A full pass produced the Trading
  V1 contract: free-port model (trade eligibility = own ship's validated current dock + active `market`
  capability), a **HYBRID cargo** model (account loot stays in `player_inventory`; a per-ship trade-hold carries
  trade goods), a **lazy player wallet** (currency separate from items), server-owned **`market_offers`**
  (price/availability, never in `location_services`), **`trade_receipts`** whole-trade idempotency, a per-offer
  **purchase-allowance** throttle, 7 proposed original commodities + a capacity-accurate 3-port matrix, and a
  route/balance simulation (no same-port profit; no unbounded reinvestment). Two hard findings: (1) a brand-new
  player has **no main ship** today (`bootstrap_me` makes only a base; `ensure_main_ship_for_player` is
  service-role-only with no player path) — so **main-ship provisioning** is the gating prerequisite; (2) trading
  needs the OSN `at_location` state, which neither `repair_main_ship` (→`home`) nor the legacy
  `send_main_ship_expedition` (→`legacy_present`) produces, while `command_main_ship_space_move_to_location`
  refuses a `home` origin by design — so a canonical **port-entry transition** is needed. Cargo-loss-on-destruction
  is deferred (free instant repair makes any recovery grant farmable). **No migration / seed / RPC / wallet /
  market / UI was created.**

**Bugs / fixes**
- Phase-9 dock proof: the in_transit fixture inserted the movement before its fleet (FK order) — fixed.
- Coord-gate proof: the disposable chain defaults `mainship_space_movement_enabled=false` (production's `true`
  is runtime, not a migration), so the first gate fired before the new gate — the proof now enables the
  movement domain on the disposable stack.

**FORWARD PLAN (approved direction; not started):**
1. **Main-ship provisioning — the prerequisite that gates all of Trading.** A one-time authenticated "Commission
   Your First Ship" claim that atomically creates ship + fleet + presence + an `at_location` dock at one
   designated **starting port** (a spawn placement, **not** a home port; `player_home_port` stays unused), plus
   a canonical OSN **port-entry transition** so existing `home`/`legacy_present` ships can reach a tradeable
   `at_location` state.
2. **Trading V1 implementation** (only after the open decisions below are approved): read model
   (`trade_goods` / `market_offers` / `player_wallet` / `ship_trade_cargo` / `trade_receipts` / allowance) →
   market capability + catalog seed → atomic idempotent buy/sell write path → Market UI from the Phase-9 dock
   seam → disposable proofs → gated deploy → read-only verifier.
3. **Then** Exploration (Phase 11) → Mining (Phase 12) → Modules/Captains (13–16) → Ranking (17) → economy/polish (18–20).
4. **Cross-cutting, deferred:** the `world_sites` canonical identity layer (build only when its F2 trigger
   fires), Online Presence & Visibility, main-ship combat, and a cargo-loss / repair-cost redesign.

**Open product decisions (need user approval before any Trading build):** cargo model (hybrid), currency (lazy
wallet, start 0), first commodities + price matrix, per-offer allowance + reset window, starting spawn port,
first-voyage starter cargo, and credit purpose (proof loop accumulating toward a future ship/captain/module sink).

## 2026-06-27 — PORT-LAUNCH: public port launch (foundation → reveal → independent verification)

The OSN-HUB-1A line (head `0067`, prior entry) advanced through the full **PORT-LAUNCH** epic: the dark
public-launch back end + front end were built and production-verified, then the three starter ports were
**revealed** in a single controlled, human-gated operation, and the result was **independently, read-only
verified** against production. Net production change: migration head **`0067` → `0068`**; authenticated
client-RPC surface **16 → 17**; the three starter ports **hidden → active/public**. **OSN port-to-port
movement stays dark** — `mainship_send_enabled = true`, `mainship_space_movement_enabled = false`,
`OSN_COORDINATE_TRAVEL_ENABLED = false` (frontend) — all unchanged by this epic.

**Requests / work done (in order):**
- **ENABLEMENT-1 (PR #36 → `3b5e6ce`).** Re-pinned `scripts/osn-enablement-preflight.sql` to head `0067` /
  surface `16`, widened space|location target checks, mirrored the function inventory into the DOCK-0 / HUB-1A
  allowlists. Tooling/gate only — no gameplay, no flag flip.
- **Fixture maintenance (PR #37 → `83d44e6`).** Replaced a global "anchors empty" assumption with an exact
  identity baseline (the three 0066 starter-port anchors). Housekeeping; depended on #36 landing first.
- **Enablement preflight (run `28253259301`).** Read-only production check → `OVERALL_PASS=true` at 0067/16.
- **PORT-LAUNCH-1A (PR #38 → `122374f`, migration `20260618000068`).** Added `reveal_starter_ports()`
  (service-role-only, one-way, all-or-nothing, never auto-invoked; locks the full sector→zone→location→anchor
  →service hierarchy before validating) and `get_osn_movement_readiness()` (authenticated, read-only; reports
  `osn_available=false` while the flag is off). Surface 16→17.
- **Deploy 0068 (run `28281667811`).** Human-gated deploy; head `0067`→`0068`; functions + surface re-lock
  only, **zero data change** (no reveal, no flag, no row touched).
- **Catalog-verifier refresh (PR #39 → `27df8e8`) + production verify (run `28288983383`, `OVERALL_PASS=true`).**
  Re-aimed the read-only catalog verifier at 0068/17; proved production still dark (ports hidden, flags off).
- **PORT-LAUNCH-1B (PR #40 → `ab07f14`).** Dark port-to-port travel UI (PortNavPanel / osnReadiness /
  portMoveCommand / osnReleaseGates); shows nothing while the flag is off; in-transit keeps route/ETA/Stop.
- **PORT-LAUNCH-2A (assessment) + 2B (PR #41 → `589abb9`).** Read-only onboarding-readiness recon, then a
  disposable full-chain proof: reveal → real `send_main_ship_expedition` accepts Haven Reach → real arrival
  settles → resolver returns anchored → readiness `anchored` (flag off) → world reverted. Added the verifier's
  A9 `STP_*` fail-closed pre-reveal checks.
- **PORT-LAUNCH-2C (PR #42 → `33af7e8`).** The controlled one-shot reveal workflow: `workflow_dispatch` only,
  `main`-only, typed `REVEAL_THREE_STARTER_PORTS` confirmation before any DB connection, `production`
  environment gate, pinned-CA verify-full, one transaction (lock → preconditions → reveal ×1 → postconditions
  incl. an **identity-level non-canonical digest** → commit-only-on-pass), rerun/uncertain fail-closed, no
  retry. Disposable proof `ok[1..6]`.
- **PORT-LAUNCH-2D (run `28294311791`).** Dispatched + approved; reveal executed once:
  `REVEAL_FUNCTION_CALLS=1 · STARTER_PORTS_ACTIVE_AFTER=3 · FLAGS_UNCHANGED=true · REVEAL_OPERATION_PASS=true`.
  Three ports hidden → active. One-way.
- **PORT-LAUNCH-2E (PR #43 → `00dfdd2`, run `28295627367`).** New independent read-only post-reveal verifier
  (`scripts/postreveal-verify.{sql,sh}` + `.github/workflows/postreveal-verify*.yml`) — leaves the dark-state
  verifier untouched; checks the server catalog **and** the authenticated `get_world_map()` boundary. Live run
  returned `MIGRATION_HEAD=0068 · CANONICAL_PORTS_ACTIVE=3 · CANONICAL_PORTS_HIDDEN=0 ·
  UNEXPECTED_PORT_STATE_CHANGES=0 · AUTHENTICATED_MAP_PORTS_VISIBLE=3 · MAINSHIP_SEND_ENABLED=true ·
  MAINSHIP_SPACE_MOVEMENT_ENABLED=false · OVERALL_PASS=true`.

**Bugs / fixes:**
- **1A lock-order TOCTOU** — reveal first locked only the three port rows; hardened to lock the full hierarchy
  (sector→zone→location→anchor→service) in a fixed order before validating; proven with concurrent psql sessions.
- **1A duplicate-insert proof premise** — the real block is a synchronous unique-constraint violation, not an
  FK lock-wait; proof corrected to assert the actual mechanism.
- **2B forced arrival** — back-dating only `arrive_at` violated `fleet_movements (arrive_at > depart_at)`;
  fixed by moving the whole travel window into the past.
- **2C postcondition** — net "+3 active" could be fooled by an offsetting change; added an `md5` digest of every
  non-canonical `(id,status)` to prove identity-level invariance.
- **2E test-harness** — a `emit_markers | grep -qx` happy-path assertion was fragile under `pipefail`; switched
  to reconcile + direct `mval` spot-checks (verifier logic itself was correct on first run).

**State after this epic (all on `main`, head `00dfdd2`):** production head **`0068`**, surface **17**, three
starter ports **active/public** (independently verified), flags unchanged (send `true`, space `false`). The
in-game OSN travel panel is built but dark. The only remaining arc item is the separate, optional, future OSN
flag-enable decision (`mainship_space_movement_enabled = true`) — **not started, not needed, not urgent.**

---

## 2026-06-26 — Session wrap-up + FORWARD PLAN (notes/design only; nothing started)

Closing-session record. **No product code / migration / workflow / verifier / flag / production change** in
this entry. Captures where things stand after OSN-HUB-1A and the deliberately-gated next steps, so the next
session can resume without re-deriving.

**State at this wrap (all on `main`):** product/production migration head **`0067`**; `main` is the
OSN-HUB-1A closure + verifier-tooling line (PRs #31 product, #32/#33 read-only verifier tooling, #34 closure
record). **OSN is DARK** and stays dark: `mainship_send_enabled = true` (legacy named-location travel LIVE),
`mainship_space_movement_enabled = false`. Hidden starter ports remain hidden/ineligible/unassigned; no
home-port assigned; no base anchor; no public OSN enablement. OSN-HUB-1A was merged → deployed (`0067`) →
read-only verified (production catalog verifier run `28229418325` = `OVERALL_PASS=true`) → formally closed
(prior entry). The legacy `bases.x/y` / `locations.x/y` coordinate path is frozen; the OSN coordinate domain
resolves origins/targets through canonical `space_anchors`.

**Reusable asset created this line of work:** a dispatch-only, production-`environment`-gated, **strictly
read-only** production catalog/ACL/configuration verifier (`scripts/osn-hub1a-production-catalog-verify.{sql,sh}`
+ `.github/workflows/osn-hub1a-production-catalog-verify.yml`, disposable proof `…-proof.yml`). It answers
"does production still match the approved dark state at head 0067?" via one `REPEATABLE READ READ ONLY`
snapshot + rollback (pinned CA / `verify-full` / session-pooler). Model future "is prod still in the approved
known state?" checks on it. **Lesson encoded in it:** Supabase hosted **default privileges** grant
`EXECUTE`-to-`service_role` on `public` functions that a migration doesn't explicitly revoke for `service_role`
— so a public RPC granted only `to authenticated` still has `service_role` EXECUTE on prod but not on the
disposable local stack; assert such platform-default ACLs as an **explicit production policy**, not
reference-vs-local parity (this was PR #33 "correction A").

**FORWARD PLAN — NOT STARTED. Each item needs its own separately-approved owner charter; do not begin on your
own. No flag flip / port reveal / home-port assignment / anchor seed as a side effect.** Ordered by readiness:

1. **ENABLEMENT-1 (tooling/gate maintenance — no gameplay, no flag flip).** Re-pin
   `scripts/osn-enablement-preflight.sql` from migration head `0064`→`0067` and the authenticated client-RPC
   surface `15`→`16` (it currently fails-closed on the new head/surface — *that is why it was deferred*).
   Update the **DOCK-0 perm allowlist** (`scripts/osn3-dock0-realchain-perm.sql`, exact-15 client-RPC list) to
   add `command_main_ship_space_move_to_location` (the same maintenance OSN-4 did for its Stop wrapper).
   Preserve the read-only / fail-closed / `verify-full` / pinned-CA contract. This unblocks a *green*
   enablement preflight; it does NOT enable anything.
2. **OSN flag-enable go/no-go (the first player-facing OSN change).** Only after ENABLEMENT-1 + a green
   production enablement preflight + an explicit owner decision: flip `mainship_space_movement_enabled=true`
   via the controlled `dev-mainship-space-movement-flag.yml` workflow. Reversible (single config key).
3. **Port-centric world build-out (heavy, charter-gated).** Reveal/seed real ports; seed canonical
   `space_anchors` for reachable locations; assign home-ports (`assign_home_port`); per the **F2 Option C**
   packet add the canonical `world_sites` identity layer (G1+) with the strict 1:1 immutable `locations`
   bridge; geographic-zones layer; possibly the **World Workbench** authoring plane first
   (`PORTCENTRIC_DECISION_PACKET.md` / `F2_COMPATIBILITY_MODEL_DECISION_PACKET.md` are the approved sources).
4. **Baseline activities & beyond (depend on OSN live + ports).** Exploration / Mining / Trading → Online
   Presence v1 → player interaction; Repair & Recovery (replace the instant-Home safelock); main-ship combat;
   captains / modules / rankings. Long-order rationale: `docs/BYEHARU_PROJECT_GUIDE.md` §10–11 and
   `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

**Ship discipline that produced this line (keep using it):** one owner-authorized step per message
(build → disposable CI proof → PR → pre-merge integrity review → admin-override no-ff merge → deploy →
read-only verify); the human owner approves every `environment: production` gate; never flip a flag / reveal a
port / dispatch or approve a workflow as a side effect; work in a throwaway worktree off `origin/main` and
never touch the stale `osn3-dock0-location-arrival` checkout.

## 2026-06-26 — OSN-HUB-1A FORMALLY CLOSED — dark canonical location-target navigation, deployed + verified (flag OFF)

Administrative closure record (notes only; **no product code / migration / workflow / verifier / flag /
production change** in this entry). **OSN-HUB-1A is formally closed.**

- **What shipped (PR #31, merge `09f8ba6`, migration `0067`).** The dark, additive **canonical location-target
  navigation** foundation: the OSN coordinate domain now resolves a docked **origin** and a named-location
  **target** through canonical `space_anchors` (NOT legacy `locations.x/y` / `bases.x/y`). One discriminated
  core writer `mainship_space_begin_move_core` (the deployed 5-arg `mainship_space_begin_move` preserved as a
  space-only delegate); the single canonical target-legality rule `mainship_space_location_target_legal`
  (active sector/zone/location + role city|port + `activity_type='none'` + one active docking service + one
  active in-bounds anchor); anchored origin resolution (HOME stays fail-closed `origin_not_anchored`, no base
  anchor); Dock-0 (`mainship_space_dock_at_location`) re-pointed from `locations.x/y` to the canonical anchor
  with **full arrival-time revalidation** under target-hierarchy `FOR SHARE` locks and a `clock_timestamp()`
  settlement time (`resolved_at >= arrive_at`); OSN-4 **Stop compatibility** for location routes (mid-flight
  interpolated stop / at-or-after-arrival settles via the SAME Dock-0 decision; `mainship_space_settle_space_arrival`
  stays strict space-only); and the one new public authenticated wrapper
  `command_main_ship_space_move_to_location(uuid, uuid)` (flag-gated before target resolution; hidden-port
  UUID ≡ nonexistent → generic `invalid_target`; **authenticated surface stays exactly 16**). Frontend is
  read-only/dark (`target_location_id` read-model; location routes render only to VISIBLE destinations).

- **Deployed.** Production migration head **`0067`** (`Deploy Supabase migrations` run `28219980298`, approved
  production gate). OSN remains **DARK**: `mainship_send_enabled = true`, `mainship_space_movement_enabled =
  false`. **No port reveal, no home-port assignment, no base anchor, no flag flip, no player/world mutation.**

- **Verified (read-only).** Final corrected production catalog/ACL/configuration verifier run **`28229418325`**
  → **`OVERALL_PASS=true`** at verified main **`30e5a36`** (verifier tooling commits; product head `0067`
  unchanged). One `REPEATABLE READ READ ONLY` snapshot + `ROLLBACK`; **no production write**. All assertions
  passed: dark-state (head 0067, flags dark, zero active coordinate movement, no incoherent pointer, empty
  `player_home_port`, no base anchor); hidden-world (3 hidden ports hidden/ineligible/absent from
  `get_world_map`, one anchor + one docking service each, original five intact); RPC surface **exactly 16** +
  anon limited to `get_world_map`; the **13 internals service_role-only** + catalog tables locked down; **6/7
  function bodies + descriptors byte-identical** ref↔prod; and the public wrapper's explicit hosted-production
  **`service_role EXECUTE = true`** policy.

- **Verifier tooling PRs.** **PR #32** (merge `09f8ba6`→… on `main`) added the dispatch-only, production-gated,
  strictly read-only verifier. **PR #33** (merge `30e5a36`) was a **verifier-only correction**: the public
  wrapper is granted only `TO authenticated` in `0067`, so its `service_role EXECUTE` is governed by Supabase
  hosted DEFAULT PRIVILEGES (allowed) which the disposable reference does not reproduce; PR #33 replaced that
  accidental local-reference dependence with an **explicit, testable hosted-production `service_role EXECUTE =
  true` contract** (strict parity preserved for the body hash + args + lang + owner + SECDEF + search_path +
  anon/authenticated/PUBLIC, and full SRVX parity for the six internals). Both PRs were **verifier tooling
  only** — no migration, no production data/ACL change.

**NEXT:** the next product step (e.g. ENABLEMENT-1 / the OSN enablement preflight re-pin to head `0067` +
surface 16, the DOCK-0 perm allowlist update, then any controlled OSN flag-enable go/no-go) requires a
**separately approved charter**. None is started. OSN remains dark.

## 2026-06-23 — ANCHOR-2 P0-A census closed + PORT-CENTRIC direction (durable handoff; design/ops only)

Cross-computer handoff record. **No code/schema/migration/anchor/resolver/flag/production change** — this entry
makes the current direction recoverable from `main`.

**1. ANCHOR-2 P0-A census — CLOSED.** One authorized, production-Environment-gated, **read-only** count-only
census ran and succeeded — workflow `osn3-anchor2-p0a-homebase-census.yml`, **run `28061856879`**, source commit
**`a12743f4829782530fc05015af509135886f8bf3`**, one `BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ READ ONLY`
snapshot then **`ROLLBACK`** (no write). Result: `TOTAL_SHIPS=72`, `ELIGIBLE=72`, `UNRESOLVED=0`; the
one-ship-per-owner invariant held (`72 = DISTINCT_NON_NULL_SHIP_OWNER_IDS`); zero null-owner/orphan/no-base/
inactive-only/multi-base anomalies. This closes **only** the old-data ambiguity prerequisite (legacy base records
are clean). **The census must not be rerun without explicit authorization.**

**2. PORT-CENTRIC direction (supersedes the home-base P0 plan).** Byeharu is a **multi-port navigation world**,
not a permanent-main-base game. A ship's meaningful normal location is its **current docked port**. Normal loop:
`Dock at Port A → depart → travel/act → dock at Port B → depart from Port B`. The permanent
`main_ship_instances.home_base_id` / ship-to-owner-base P0 plan is **CANCELLED** (no FK / NOT NULL / backfill /
creation-path change). Legacy `bases` are **bootstrap / starter / registration / possible-recovery records only**,
never operational homes. "Return home" is **not** ordinary navigation; emergency recovery is separate future work.

**3. Technical boundary.** The existing dark `at_location` state (ship `spatial_state='at_location'` + the fleet's
`current_location_id` + an active `location_presence`) is the **proto current-dock model**. `space_anchors`
(migration 0063, empty/dark) remains the **future fixed-coordinate foundation**. Future port docking/departure must
resolve through **location identity + the eligible port's canonical `space_anchors` (kind='location') coordinate** —
not legacy `locations.x/y`. The current dark DOCK-0 exact-match against `locations.x/y` (migration 0061) is proto
behavior only and **remains unchanged**.

**4. Map-growth policy.** The open-space boundary stays **≈ `[-10000, 10000]²`** — a **temporary technical
frontier**, not a permanent world/lore edge; no final map size is chosen. Future expansion grows **outward** and
**preserves all existing coordinates** (do not remap/move existing ports, anchors, ships, or players); keep the
initial central region **dense** and reserve outer space for later. **No map-size expansion is authorized now.**

**5. Exact next project gate.** *Next work is a **port-centric product-decision packet**: port eligibility, dock
identity, legacy-base/recovery role, recovery model, anchor-seeding scope, and initial central-region layout
policy. No ANCHOR-2 implementation, anchor seeding, resolver change, map work, coordinate command work, migration,
or flag change is authorized before those decisions.*

Live baseline unchanged at this handoff: production migrations end at **0063**; `mainship_send_enabled=true`,
`mainship_space_movement_enabled=false`; OSN paused.

## 2026-06-23 — MSP-0: Main Ship Progression ↔ Movement integration contract (design only)

Read-only reconnaissance + integration contract answering where future main-ship progression stats must live
so the current named-location route and future OSN movement consume **one** server-calculated result. **No
code/migration/workflow/flag/branch change — design packet only.**

- **Speed-truth trace.** Both routes derive main-ship speed solely from `main_ship_hull_types.base_speed`
  (`starter_frigate=1.0`): legacy `send_main_ship_expedition`/`move_main_ship_to_location`/
  `request_main_ship_return` → `resolve_fleet_movement_speed` → `movement_create` (LIVE); OSN
  `mainship_space_begin_move` reads the hull inline + computes duration inline, with `resolve_fleet_movement_speed`
  only as an equality assert (DARK). Speed + `arrive_at` are snapshotted once at departure, never recomputed at
  arrival. Frontend submits **intent only** (no client speed/duration math; the one `previewTravelSeconds` is
  dead code).
- **Divergence to prevent (already nascent):** `calculate_expedition_stats` computes a support-craft speed
  penalty that live movement ignores.
- **Recommendation (Option B):** one private main-ship-keyed `mainship_effective_stats` resolver
  (`effective_travel_speed` first; empty loadout ≡ raw hull base ⇒ current behavior byte-for-byte unchanged)
  that both movement adapters consume. First slice = **module-first**, first effect = travel speed on the live
  named-location route. Phases MSP-0..MSP-4 defined; module/captain schema is greenfield (only integer
  `module_slots`/`captain_slots` counts exist today).

**No implementation started.** Flags unchanged (`mainship_send_enabled=true`, `mainship_space_movement_enabled=false`);
migrations end at **0063**. NEXT (needs approval): Option-B decision + **MSP-1** (additive, dark module-ownership
schema only). ANCHOR-2 / seeding / resolver extension / S6B-PRES / coordinate enablement remain deferred.

## 2026-06-23 — OSN-ANCHOR-1B: empty canonical-anchor schema (`space_anchors`) — DEPLOYED & CLOSED (flag OFF)

Additive, EMPTY, server-only canonical-anchor foundation (branch `osn3-anchor1b-space-anchors`, PR #18 merge
**`7264f12`**, migration **`0063`**). `public.space_anchors`: closed `kind ∈ {base,location}` with **exactly
one real typed owner FK** (`base_id`→`bases` ON DELETE CASCADE, `location_id`→`locations` ON DELETE RESTRICT;
no ownerless / all-null / polymorphic `(kind, owner_uuid)`); coords NOT NULL + finite + within `[-10000,10000]²`
(rejects NULL/NaN/±Inf/oob); partial-unique **one active anchor per base & per location** (no `(space_x,space_y)`
unique — intentional co-location stays possible); BEFORE-UPDATE immutability guard (SECURITY INVOKER,
`search_path=public`: active→retired only; kind/owner/x/y/created_at immutable; retired terminal; DELETE
unguarded so base CASCADE works); private RLS (no policy) + explicit revoke from public/anon/authenticated +
grant **service_role-only**.

**Seeds NOTHING; copies nothing from `bases.x/y`/`locations.x/y`; NOT read by `mainship_space_resolve_origin`
(resolver UNCHANGED → `home`/`at_location`/`legacy_*` still resolve `origin_not_anchored`); no flag/resolver/
docking/movement/UI change.** Proof: disposable real-chain `osn3-anchor1b-realchain-proof.yml` (all 17 points —
shape/types/RLS/indexes/checks/trigger, kinds/owners/coords/uniqueness/immutability, base-cascade, location-
restrict, ACL, resolver-unchanged; asserts table empty) + S1–S6A / DOCK-0 / ANCHOR-1A non-regression + Build,
all GREEN. (Three proofs first failed on a transient Docker-pull `502` at `supabase start` — proof step skipped,
not a defect — and reran green with no code change.)

**Deploy:** production-Environment-gated run **`28025760972`** (approved) applied exactly `0063` ("Finished
supabase db push"); remote migration history now ends **`20260618000063`** (no `0064+`). Live confirm: anon REST
`GET /space_anchors` → HTTP `401` `42501` permission-denied (table **exists** in prod, clients **denied**); flags
`mainship_send_enabled=true`, `mainship_space_movement_enabled=false`. **OSN is now PAUSED at this boundary.**
NEXT: **Main Ship Progression (MSP)** — not ANCHOR-2.

## 2026-06-23 — OSN-ANCHOR-1A: production catalog-parity verification — CLOSED

Verified the deployed truthful-origin resolver `mainship_space_resolve_origin` (migration `0062`) is
**byte-identical + semantically identical to source** in production, via a dedicated, strictly read-only
catalog-parity spotcheck. Built across two PRs: **#16 (`2b11f28`)** added the `osn3-anchor1a-catalog-spotcheck`
workflow + script capability; **#17 (`cb0219a`)** a CA-trust remediation after the first production run failed
`sslmode=verify-full` against the shared IPv4 pooler — pinned the official **Supabase Root 2021 CA**
(`scripts/supabase-prod-ca.crt`, cert SHA-256 `807025ad50d4ed219d2c9c7d299c004f824eb00cf7f65afef607d07b72e6cafa`)
+ used the **session pooler (port 5432)**; kept `verify-full`, **no TLS downgrade**.

Production verification run **`28022976137`** (workflow_dispatch on `main`, production gate approved) PASSED: raw
stored-body `prosrc` SHA-256 `7d4548e64e2fca60a944fe2875c0b8e3e381c85bb0960f14bb8670d71d6038b0` identical
reference-vs-production (exact, no normalization); 17-field descriptor parity identical; invariants OK
(plpgsql / owner=postgres / SECURITY DEFINER / `search_path=public` / service_role-only; anon/authenticated/PUBLIC
denied); remote migration history ends exactly `0062`; read-only gate proven before any catalog query; **no
production write**. Equality source = raw `p.prosrc` (version-stable), NOT `pg_get_functiondef`. Flags unchanged
(send=true, space=false). No resolver/data/flag change.

## 2026-06-22 — OSN-ANCHOR-1A: truthful-origin guard (dark) — DEPLOYED & CLOSED (flag OFF)

Migration **`0062`** (branch `osn3-anchor1a-truthful-origin`, PR #15 merge **`fb28481`**) re-creates
`mainship_space_resolve_origin(uuid)` (CREATE OR REPLACE; signature / SECURITY DEFINER / `search_path=public` /
service_role-only all preserved) so `home` / `legacy_home` / `at_location` / `legacy_present` now resolve
**`{ok:false, reason:'origin_not_anchored'}`** instead of reading legacy `bases.x/y` / `locations.x/y` as a
movement origin; `in_space` unchanged (origin = ship `space_x/space_y`); `in_transit`→`must_stop`;
`destroyed`→`destroyed`. Closes the proven defect of legacy dynamic-map coordinates leaking into OSN movement
origins. **NO anchor table, NO bases/locations column, NO seed/backfill, NO legacy fallback; both flags
untouched** (send=true, space=false).

Proof: real chain `0001..0062` (`osn3-anchor1a-realchain-proof.yml`) — the four legacy/home states →
`origin_not_anchored` (no movement / receipt / legacy-origin written); `in_space` success with origin == ship
coord; rejected-request idempotency; resolver ACL/security/signature parity; cross-domain / destruction / DOCK-0
non-regression. Deployed via production-gated run **`27988863386`**; production catalog-parity verification
followed separately (see the 2026-06-23 catalog-parity entry). Coordinate movement stays dark.

## 2026-06-22 — OSN-3 S6C: flag-dark empty-space coordinate command surface — CLOSED (flag OFF)

Frontend-only coordinate-move command path (branch `osn3-s6c-empty-space-coordinate-command`, PR #14 merge
**`9ce5567`**, **no migration / RPC / flag / server change**). Empty-space map tap → `screenToWorld` →
canonicalized target → existing S6A wrapper `command_main_ship_space_move(p_target_x, p_target_y, p_request_id)`.
Layered gating (feature flag `mainship_space_movement_enabled` read once; eligibility; controls/crosshair mount
only when enabled + within bounds; tap qualifies only on empty SVG) → **production-dark**: flag false ⇒ wrapper
returns `feature_disabled` and writes nothing. The client submits **intent only** (target coords + `request_id`);
never a speed/duration/stat/ship-id. Build green; flags unchanged (send=true, space=false). NEXT then was the
S6B presentation foundation + ANCHOR truthful-origin work.

---

## 2026-06-22 — OSN-3 S6B: fixed-space frontend coordinate foundation — CLOSED (flag OFF, read-only)

S6B closes the **read-only frontend coordinate-rendering foundation** for open space across four merged
sub-slices. It is **not** a player-enabled movement feature: coordinate movement remains **production-dark**
(`mainship_space_movement_enabled=false`; `mainship_send_enabled=true`), there is **no player command path,
tap selection, selected-target persistence, or coordinate-movement enablement**, and **no migration / RPC /
flag / server change** in any S6B slice (migrations remain through **0060**).

- **S6B1** (merge `586d67c`) — `src/features/map/openSpaceTransform.ts`: a **pure** fixed-domain transform —
  `worldToViewBox`/`viewBoxToWorld` over `[-10000,10000]→[0,1000]` (explicit Y-inversion), `worldToScreen`/
  `screenToWorld` (camera + `preserveAspectRatio` letterbox), and a **separate** `isWithinOpenSpaceBounds`
  predicate (no hidden clamping; conversions never validate). Verifier `verify:osn:s6b`.
- **S6B2** (merge `f7974ac`) — a **mandatory discriminated** `coordinateSpace: 'legacy_dynamic' |
  'open_space_fixed'` on the resolved `ShipMarker`; the ship's open-space states (`in_space`, coordinate
  `in_transit`) route through the fixed transform while legacy/named states keep `buildNormalizer`.
  Exhaustive switch + `never` guard, no silent legacy fallback. Verifier `verify:osn:resolver`.
- **S6B3** (merge `e2de473`) — a **development-only**, non-interactive fixed-space preview
  (`DevFixedSpacePreview`), gated **solely** by `import.meta.env.DEV` and **compile-time eliminated** from
  the production bundle — proven by `vite build` + a `dist/` grep showing the `s6b3-dev-preview` sentinel
  and the component are **absent** (true removal, not runtime hiding). `pointerEvents:none`, `aria-hidden`,
  minimal hollow ring/crosshair. Verifier `verify-s6b3`.
- **S6B4** (merge `adc7009`) — behavior-preserving extraction of `MainShipMarker`'s routing into a pure
  exported `markerViewBoxPoint(marker, norm)` that **the component and the tests both call** (no duplicate);
  proves a **resolved** `open_space_fixed` marker is projected through `worldToViewBox` (the dynamic `norm`
  is **never** called) and that the preview + a distinct fixed-space ship point **co-move** under the camera
  (screen Δ = letterbox·zoom × viewBox Δ across zoom 0.4/1/2/8 × zero/nonzero pan × square/wide/tall/mobile
  viewports; pure geometry, no comparison to dynamic named-location coords). Verifiers `verify:osn:resolver`
  + `verify:osn:s6b`.

**Acceptance (all green):** `verify:osn:s6b` (transform) · `verify:osn:resolver` (provenance + S6B4 routing)
· `verify-s6b3` (dev preview + production-elimination) · `build` (tsc -b + vite build) · post-merge **Build +
Pages** deploy. On production data the ship marker is always `legacy_dynamic` (open-space states are dark)
and the dev preview is absent → **zero production visual change**.

**Explicitly NOT done / still pending.** Fixed-space markers and legacy named locations are **not yet an
approved co-registered presentation**. **S6B-PRES is mandatory before any S6D enablement** — it must
charter, implement, and prove **either** named locations rendered through a verified fixed-domain transform
**or** a distinct coordinate-navigation map mode where legacy dynamic markers are hidden/non-spatial. No
tap/`mapToWorld` wiring (S6C), no command/CTA/RPC, no flag flip.

**NEXT:** OSN-3 **S6B-PRES** reconnaissance — the fixed-space ↔ named-location presentation decision (the
mandatory pre-S6D gate). S6C input wiring must **not** precede that decision.

## 2026-06-21 — OSN-3 S6A: public coordinate-command boundary (flag-dark) — CLOSED (flag OFF)

First **player-facing** coordinate-movement command surface (branch `osn3-s6a-public-space-move-command`,
no-ff merge **`ac9230a`**, code commit `581dea9`, migration **`0060`**). A narrow, **authenticated**,
SECURITY DEFINER wrapper **`command_main_ship_space_move(p_target_x, p_target_y, p_request_id)`** that
derives the caller from `auth.uid()`, derives the caller's **own** main ship server-side (**no client
player/ship id**), defense-in-depth flag-gates, **canonicalizes** the target to the integer world-unit
grid (`round(numeric)` — half **away from zero**, deterministic; non-finite rejected before the cast;
bounds remain the writer's authority, so a raw value with `|canonical| ≤ 10000` snaps inward and is
accepted), **DELEGATES** to the existing private writer `mainship_space_begin_move`, and **maps** the
result to a narrow player-safe payload. Canonicalization is a discrete-grid concern only — **`p_request_id`
remains the idempotency key**. The private writer stays the **final authority** on flag/ownership/bounds/
state/exclusion/travel-cap/locking/idempotency/movement-creation and remains **service_role-only** (the
client never gains it; the definer-owner `postgres` invokes it). **NO writer/processor/S2/S5 change, NO
new table/cron, NO flag flip, NO UI/CTA.**

**Dark in production:** `mainship_space_movement_enabled` stays **false**, so the wrapper returns
`feature_disabled` and writes nothing → **net player-visible effect: none**. `mainship_send_enabled` stays
**true**; legacy named-location travel is untouched and **mutually exclusive** with coordinate movement
(proven both directions: a coordinate-domain ship rejects legacy send/move by precondition; a legacy-busy
ship rejects the coordinate command via cross-domain exclusion; the fleet `active_movement_id` XOR
`active_space_movement_id` holds).

Also: sibling dev flag tool **`dev-mainship-space-movement-flag.mjs`** (+ workflow) for the coordinate flag
(legacy send-flag tool untouched; **not** run against prod in S6A); **`fetchMainshipSpaceMovementEnabled()`**
typed read in `src/lib/catalog.ts` (no UI wiring — an S6B seed). The migration re-locks the execute surface
(canonical client RPCs **+ the new wrapper**; writer/processor/destruction/S2 helpers stay service_role-only).

**Authoritative proof (real chain `0001..0060`, disposable Supabase; `osn3-s6a-realchain-proof.yml`).**
GREEN: permission/boundary (wrapper authenticated-only, owner postgres / SECURITY DEFINER / search_path
public / no dynamic SQL / no player-or-ship param; private writer + S4 + S5 + four S2 helpers
service_role-only; canonical client-RPC inventory = prior 13 **+** the wrapper); runtime **SET ROLE** (anon
denied / authenticated allowed on the wrapper; writer client-denied, service_role-allowed); fixture matrix
(dark→`feature_disabled` + no write; success from home/in_space/at_location; canonicalization
half-away-from-zero + near-edge inward snap + `out_of_bounds`/non-finite reject; `zero_distance`;
idempotency exact **and** equivalent-canonical replay + `request_conflict` + no duplicate; state matrix
`in_transit→must_stop_first` / `destroyed→ship_destroyed` / legacy-busy`→busy_legacy`; legacy↔coordinate
mutual exclusion both directions + fleet pointer XOR); REST boundary (private writer rejected for anon **and**
authenticated; wrapper reachable for authenticated but dark → `feature_disabled`, no movement). Flags
restored `if: always()`.

**Gates (all green):** S6A real-chain proof; **S1–S5 real-chain regression**; Build (`tsc -b` + `vite
build`); `deploy-migrations` (live `db push` of 0060); post-deploy integration **Verify**; live legacy
regressions `verify-mainship-send` (send **+ return/recall**), `verify-mainship-move`,
`verify-mainship-repair`. **Live read-only spot check** (`osn3-s6a-live-spotcheck.yml`): 0060 applied;
wrapper present **authenticated-only**; private engine **service_role-only**; canonical inventory intact;
one S4 arrival cron @30s; `mainship_send_enabled=true`, `mainship_space_movement_enabled=false`, cap=86400;
`main_ship_space_movements=0`, `command_receipts=0` — **no game-state mutation by the deploy**. (An earlier
batch of live runs was **cancelled** by the shared `live-db-tests` concurrency group — a workflow-concurrency
incident, not a test failure; each was re-run serially to a real `success`.)

**NEXT (not started, needs approval):** OSN-3 **S6B** — the fixed-domain paired coordinate transform
(`worldToMap`/`mapToWorld` over `[-10000,10000]`, Y-inverting, pan/zoom-aware) **+ a read-only target
preview**, still flag-off. No map tap/CTA until S6C; no enablement until S6D; OSN-4 Stop remains deferred.

## 2026-06-21 — OSN-3 S5: coordinate-complete trusted destruction primitive — CLOSED (flag OFF)

Fifth **OSN-3** slice (branch `osn3-s5-destruction-hardening`, approved head `a7ab585`, normal **no-ff**
merge **`0d84256`**, migration **`0059`**; final `main == origin/main == fda8778` after a read-only
live-spot-check tooling commit). **Narrow hardening only — NO public RPC, NO UI, NO new processor/cron,
NO Return/Stop, NO generic reconciliation, NO flag change.** Both flags untouched (`mainship_send_enabled`
stays **true**, `mainship_space_movement_enabled` stays **false**).

**The defect S5 fixes.** `dev_set_main_ship_destroyed(p_player uuid)` — the **unique** trusted main-ship
destruction writer (audited: the only fn that sets `main_ship_instances.status='destroyed'`/`hp=0`;
combat destroys legacy unit-fleets via `fleet_destroy`, never main ships; `repair_main_ship` only
recovers) — predated the coordinate domain and therefore could **not** destroy a ship in a valid
coordinate state without violating a coordinate constraint (`in_transit` left
`fleets.active_space_movement_id` set → violates `fleets_active_space_movement_requires_moving`;
`in_space`/`at_location` left a non-null `spatial_state` → violates the `…_ss_*_status` CHECKs). Latent
(service_role-only path; coordinate movement dark), but closed before coordinate movement is ever enabled.

**Migration 0059** re-creates **only** `dev_set_main_ship_destroyed` (same signature, `SECURITY DEFINER`,
owner `postgres`, `search_path=public`, **service_role-only**, no player wrapper, no new cron). It:
acquires `mainship_space_lock_context(id,false)` first (canonical order; never locks `fleet_movements`);
requires `validate_context` ok — **any generic contradiction ABORTS atomically with all rows unchanged**;
for a coherent `in_transit` cancels the active coordinate movement → `status='cancelled'`,
`terminal_reason='ship_destroyed'`, `resolved_at` (history preserved); clears `active_space_movement_id`;
preserves the existing legacy cleanup; and sets the ship `destroyed`/`hp=0`/**`spatial_state=NULL`**/
`space_x`/`space_y` NULL (NULL — not `'destroyed'` — so `repair_main_ship`, which sets `status='home'`
without resetting `spatial_state`, stays valid → a repaired ship is a clean `legacy_home`). The S3 command
receipt is immutable; no history deletion. `repair_main_ship`, the S4 processor, the S3 writer, the S2
helpers, and all legacy writers are untouched; migrations `0052/0055/0056/0057/0058` are untouched.

**Authoritative proof (real chain `0001..0059`, disposable Supabase; `osn3-s5-realchain-proof.yml`).**
GREEN at `a7ab585`: coherent destruction of `in_transit` (movement→cancelled/ship_destroyed, receipt
immutable), `in_space`, `at_location`, and preserved `legacy_present`; idempotent repeated destruction;
**real `repair_main_ship` after destruction → clean `legacy_home`** with no coordinate residue; the full
contradiction-abort matrix (active legacy movement, unexpected presence, pointer/ownership mismatch,
multiple fleets, in_transit-without-movement, destroyed-plus-moving) each non-mutating; real
concurrent-session races (arrival-wins-then-destroy-clears-`in_space`; destruction-wins-arrival-never-
settles-cancelled; two destructions race → one terminal, second idempotent); runtime ACL + SET ROLE
denial; REST/RPC denial of the primitive + processor + writer + S2 helpers for anon and a real
authenticated JWT. *Root-cause note:* the first run was red only on a **proof-harness** transaction
defect (concurrency sessB ran destruction in autocommit, never observed idle-in-transaction); fixed by
holding sessB's destruction in a txn — **the migration/primitive needed no change** (no `0060`).

**Gates (all green at `a7ab585`):** S5 real-chain proof; S1/S2/S3/S4 real-chain regression; the Build
gate via draft PR #3 (`npm ci`, lint, `tsc -b`, `vite build`); `verify:osn:resolver`; the legacy-send
read-only verifier. **Live read-only spot check** (`osn3-s5-live-spotcheck.yml`, post-deploy): 0059
applied; primitive present with the approved signature (`p_player uuid`), owner=postgres, SECURITY
DEFINER, search_path=public, no dynamic SQL, no player wrapper, service_role-only; canonical client-RPC
inventory unchanged; `repair_main_ship` still authenticated-executable; S2 helpers + S3 writer + S4

`main_ship_space_movements=0`, `main_ship_space_command_receipts=0` — no game-state mutation by the deploy
or verification.

**Scope confirmation.** S5 added **no** player coordinate RPC, UI, processor/cron, Return, Stop, generic
reconciliation, history cleanup/retention, legacy-writer change, `repair_main_ship` change, S2/S3/S4
helper change, or feature enablement. The internal coordinate lifecycle is now complete and dark:
**departure (S3) → arrival settlement (S4) → parked `in_space` → coordinate-complete destruction (S5)**.
**NEXT (not started, awaiting a separate explicit charter):** a PC-first coordinate command/map surface
(public wrapper + UI, gated by `mainship_space_movement_enabled`), then **OSN-4 Stop**.

## 2026-06-21 — OSN-3 S4: coordinate-arrival processor — CLOSED (flag OFF)

Fourth **OSN-3** slice (branch `osn3-s4-arrival-processor`, approved head `33588e2`, normal **no-ff**
merge **`6b1a88e`**, migration **`0058`**; final `main == origin/main == 6b1a88e`). **One private,
server-only background PROCESSOR — still NO public RPC, NO UI, NO Return/Stop, NO feature enablement,
NO reconciliation/destruction.** `mainship_space_movement_enabled` stays **false** (the processor does
not gate on it); `mainship_send_enabled` stays **true** (untouched legacy path).

**Migration 0058 — `public.process_mainship_space_arrivals() returns integer`.** One `SECURITY DEFINER`,
owner `postgres`, `search_path=public`, **service_role-only** processor (PUBLIC/anon/authenticated
revoked; no player wrapper), driven by a **pg_cron** job `process-mainship-space-arrivals` at the
established **`30 seconds`** cadence (`command = select public.process_mainship_space_arrivals();`,
idempotent unschedule-by-name). It settles each due, still-coherent S3 coordinate movement **exactly
once**: non-locking candidate scan (`status='moving' and arrive_at<=now()`, `ORDER BY arrive_at,id LIMIT
100`) → per ship `mainship_space_lock_context(id, true)` skip-locked (S2 canonical order ship → fleet →
coordinate-movement → presence; never locks legacy `fleet_movements`) → `validate_context` must be
`in_transit` → `assert_cross_domain_exclusion` → re-confirm under lock → atomic settlement.

- **Arrival transition:** movement **`moving → arrived`** (`resolved_at=now()`,
  `terminal_reason='auto_arrival'`; immutable origin/target/speed/time history preserved); fleet
  **`moving → completed`** with `location_mode='movement'` and `active_space_movement_id` /
  `active_movement_id` / `current_*` cleared (truthful open-space terminal — verified legal once the
  space pointer is NULL; no base field set, `fleet_complete()` not used); ship **`traveling`/`in_transit`
  → `stationary`/`in_space`** at the movement's `target_x`/`target_y`.
- **Terminal history preserved** (the `arrived` row stays; existing FK CASCADE cleans it only on
  owner/ship deletion — no retention/cleanup job added). The S3 creation receipt is immutable; S4 writes
  no receipt and creates/leaves no `location_presence`.
- **Contradiction policy (frozen):** every contradiction / malformed / destroyed / legacy-conflict /
  presence-conflict / pointer-mismatch / ownership-mismatch / not-due / already-terminal case is left
  **untouched** with a concise log (no settle/fail/repair/normalize/delete; hardening deferred to S5).
- **Flag rule:** the processor never reads `mainship_space_movement_enabled` (so disabling it can't
  strand in-transit ships) and never touches `mainship_send_enabled`.

**Authoritative proof (real chain `0001..0058`, disposable Supabase; `osn3-s4-realchain-proof.yml`).**
GREEN at `33588e2`: due settles exactly once; not-yet-due stays moving; second call settles 0
(idempotent); two concurrent processors settle once (loser skip-locked); skip-locked ship skipped then
settles; settlement proceeds with the space flag FALSE; full arrival-state assertions (movement
arrived/`auto_arrival`/`resolved`, ship `stationary`/`in_space` at exact target, fleet `completed`/
`movement` with pointers+base cleared, no presence, no legacy mv, S2 `validate_context`=`in_space`, S3
receipt unchanged, terminal history present); the seven contradiction cases each proven non-mutating
(per-ship state hash) as real due candidates; runtime ACL + SET ROLE denial; REST/RPC denial of the
processor + writer + S2 helpers for anon and a real authenticated JWT; cron asserted present once @30s;
cleanup + flags/cap/cron restored & asserted. *Root-cause note:* the first proof run was red on a
**fixture** timestamp assumption only (transaction-scoped `now()` made `arrive_at < depart_at`),
corrected by moving both timestamps into the past + asserting every fixture's precondition; **the
processor/0058 needed no change** (no `0059`).

**Gates (all green at `33588e2`):** S4 real-chain proof; S1/S2/S3 real-chain regression; the Build gate
via draft PR #2 (`npm ci`, lint, `tsc -b`, `vite build`); `verify:osn:resolver`; the legacy-send
read-only activation verifier. **Live read-only spot check** (`osn3-s4-live-spotcheck.yml`, post-deploy):
0058 applied; processor present with the approved signature (no args), owner=postgres, SECURITY DEFINER,
search_path=public, no dynamic SQL, no player wrapper, service_role-only (anon/authenticated/PUBLIC
denied); S3 writer + four S2 helpers service_role-only; canonical client-RPC inventory unchanged;
anon/authenticated cannot CREATE in `public`; **exactly one** cron job `process-mainship-space-arrivals`
@ `30 seconds` (no duplicate); `mainship_send_enabled=true`, `mainship_space_movement_enabled=false`,
`max_coordinate_travel_seconds=86400`; **`main_ship_space_movements`=0 and
`main_ship_space_command_receipts`=0** — live deployment created zero coordinate movements and zero
receipts; no game-state side effect (a natural cron tick that finds zero due movements is harmless).

**Scope confirmation.** S4 added **no** player coordinate RPC, UI, Return, Stop, reconciliation/auto-
repair, destruction/repair behavior, history cleanup/retention, legacy-writer/processor change, S2/S3
helper change, or feature enablement. `mainship_send_enabled=true` remains the temporary playable legacy
named-location path; `mainship_space_movement_enabled=false` remains dark. **NEXT (not started, awaiting
a separate explicit S5 charter):** reconciler / destruction hardening (S5) → target UI (S7) → a public
player wrapper for the writer → **OSN-4 Stop** (S8).

## 2026-06-21 — Legacy main-ship send: controlled production activation (config-only, reversible)

Enabled the **already-built legacy named-location** main-ship travel path on live by flipping **one**
game-config key via the established controlled workflow `dev-mainship-flag.yml` →
`scripts/dev-mainship-flag.mjs --enabled true` (writes only `mainship_send_enabled` via the owned
`set_game_config`). **No migration, no code/UI change, no fixtures, no test users, no writer execution.**

**Target/result live config:** `mainship_send_enabled = true`, **`mainship_space_movement_enabled =
false`** (untouched), `max_coordinate_travel_seconds = 86400` (untouched). The activation script logged
`Before: false → After: true`.

**Read-only preflight** (`osn3-s3-live-spotcheck`, run `27899732391`): confirmed the pre-state —
send=false, space=false, cap=86400, `main_ship_space_movements`=0, `main_ship_space_command_receipts`=0,
S3 writer + four S2 helpers service_role-only, canonical client-RPC inventory unchanged. **Read-only
post-activation verification** (`osn3-legacy-send-activation-check`, run `27899841147`): confirmed
send=true, space_movement=false, cap=86400, `main_ship_space_movements`=0, `command_receipts`=0, and
that `mainship_space_begin_move` + the four S2 helpers remain **service_role-only / non-client-executable**
with the canonical client-RPC inventory unchanged and `public`-schema CREATE denied to anon/authenticated.

**What this does / does not do.** It re-exposes only the **legacy named-location** player capability
(`send_main_ship_expedition` base→location, `move_main_ship_to_location` location→location, plus the
always-available recovery paths `request_main_ship_return` and `repair_main_ship`). It does **not**
enable coordinate movement or any OSN player command: the S3 coordinate writer stays service_role-only
and flag-dark (`mainship_space_movement_enabled=false`), no coordinate UI/command surface exists, and no
coordinate movement or command receipt was created (both counts remain 0). No game-state row was created
or modified by the activation. **Rollback** is the same controlled workflow with
`mainship_send_enabled=false` (single-key, instant, no migration). **S4 has not started.**

---

## 2026-06-21 — OSN-3 S3: first internal coordinate-movement writer — CLOSED (flag OFF)

Third **OSN-3** slice (branch `osn3-s3-begin-move-writer`, approved head `e267eee`, normal **no-ff**
merge **`f4ba07e`**, migration **`0057`**; final `main == origin/main == f4ba07e`). **One private,
server-only WRITER — still NO public RPC, NO UI, NO processor, NO arrival/Return/Stop, NO feature
enablement.** Both flags stay false on live.

**Migration 0057 — `public.mainship_space_begin_move(p_player uuid, p_main_ship_id uuid, p_target_x
double precision, p_target_y double precision, p_request_id uuid) returns jsonb`.** One `SECURITY
DEFINER`, owner `postgres`, `search_path=public`, **service_role-only** function (PUBLIC/anon/
authenticated revoked) that composes the deployed S2 boundary — `mainship_space_lock_context` →
`mainship_space_validate_context` → `mainship_space_assert_cross_domain_exclusion` →
`mainship_space_resolve_origin` — to begin exactly one coordinate move. Hard-gated on
`mainship_space_movement_enabled` (stays false); `mainship_send_enabled` untouched. Adds one additive
non-flag guard `max_coordinate_travel_seconds=86400` (the `[-10000,10000]²` envelope is the distance
bound; no `MAX_COORDINATE_MOVE_DISTANCE`).

- **Supported stationary origins:** `home`/`legacy_home`/`in_space` (materialise a new main-ship fleet
  in-txn) and `at_location`/`legacy_present` (reuse the present fleet, closing its active presence).
  **Space-only target contract** (`target_kind='space'` + `p_target_x`/`p_target_y` + `p_request_id`);
  the client never supplies origin/player/ownership/state/fleet/speed/ETA/status or screen coords.
- **One atomic transaction, canonical S2 lock order** (ship → fleet → coordinate-movement → presence);
  never locks legacy `fleet_movements`; never calls a frozen legacy writer. Creates one `moving`
  `main_ship_space_movements` row + coherent fleet pointer (`active_space_movement_id`, legacy
  `active_movement_id` stays NULL) + ship `traveling`/`in_transit` + finalised idempotency receipt.
- **Idempotency** via `main_ship_space_command_receipts (main_ship_id, request_id)`: same id + same
  canonical payload hash → replays the committed `result_json`; same id + changed payload →
  `request_id_payload_conflict`; rejections write no receipt.
- **Validate-before-mutate:** every admission rejection (incl. `travel_time_exceeds_limit`) returns
  `{ok:false,reason}` *before* any write — no rejection leaves an orphan fleet/movement/ship/presence/
  receipt; only a genuine integrity fault raises and rolls back.

**Authoritative proof (real chain `0001..0057`, disposable Supabase; `osn3-s3-realchain-proof.yml`).**
GREEN at `e267eee`: positives from all five origins (each asserting `movement.origin == resolved
origin`, `speed_used == resolve_fleet_movement_speed(fleet)`, coherent fleet/ship/receipt, presence
closed once); the full rejection matrix each proven non-mutating; idempotent replay + payload conflict;
real concurrent-session races (two distinct → one move, loser rejects after revalidation; two
same-request retries → identical committed receipt); `travel_time_exceeds_limit` with explicit
no-effect; runtime ACL + SET ROLE denial; REST/RPC denial of the writer + S2 helpers for anon and a
real authenticated JWT; cleanup + flags/cap restored & asserted. *Root-cause note:* the first proof run
was red on a **fixture** assumption only (the real chain auto-provisions a Home Base at (0,0) via
`initialize_new_player`, so the zero-distance fixture's hard-coded target was wrong) — corrected by
deriving every origin from `mainship_space_resolve_origin`; **the writer/0057 needed no change** (no
`0058`).

**Gates (all green at `e267eee`):** S3 real-chain proof; S1 trigger/FK + S2 real-chain regression; the
Build gate via draft PR #1 (`npm ci`, lint, `tsc -b`, `vite build`); `verify:osn:resolver` (resolver
unit suite). **Live read-only spot check** (`osn3-s3-live-spotcheck.yml`, post-deploy): 0057 applied;
writer present with the exact approved signature, owner=postgres, SECURITY DEFINER, search_path=public,
no dynamic SQL, `acl={postgres,service_role}` (anon/authenticated/PUBLIC denied); four S2 helpers
service_role-only; canonical client-RPC inventory unchanged; anon/authenticated cannot CREATE in
`public`; `mainship_send_enabled=false`, `mainship_space_movement_enabled=false`,
`max_coordinate_travel_seconds=86400`; **`main_ship_space_movements`=0 and
`main_ship_space_command_receipts`=0** — no coordinate movement created live, no game-state side effect.
No fixtures/users/movements/receipts created by the deployment.

**Scope confirmation.** S3 added **no** public player RPC, UI, processor/cron, arrival settlement,
Return, Stop, reconciler, repair/destruction, legacy-writer change, S2-helper change, or feature
enablement. **NEXT (not started, awaiting a separate explicit S4 charter):** arrival processor (S4) →
reconciler/destruction hardening (S5) → target UI (S7) → OSN-4 Stop (S8).

## 2026-06-21 — OSN-3 S2: internal transition boundary + validation core — CLOSED (flag OFF)

Second **OSN-3** slice (branch `osn3-s2-transition-core`, approved head `1f2c45d`, normal **no-ff** merge
`93cb977`, migration `0056`). **Private, server-only transition boundary — NO movement writer, NO
processor, NO Stop, NO UI, NO public RPC, NO flag change.** Current `main == origin/main == a38247f`
(the four commits after `93cb977` changed **only** read-only live-verification tooling:
`.github/workflows/osn3-s2-live-spotcheck.yml`, `scripts/osn3-s2-live-spotcheck.sh`,
`scripts/osn3-s2-live-inspect.sql`). No history rewrite / force-push / rebase / squash / reset.

**Migration 0056 — four `SECURITY DEFINER` helpers (server-only), the locking/validation core for the
future coordinate-move writer (S3+):**
- `public.mainship_space_lock_context(uuid, boolean)` — acquires per-ship locks in the canonical order
  `main_ship_instances → fleets → main_ship_space_movements → location_presence`; never locks legacy
  `fleet_movements` (non-locking `EXISTS` read only); `boolean` = skip-lock (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`
  at the ship row → returns `skipped` with no downstream locks).
- `public.mainship_space_validate_context(uuid)` — validates the full ship/fleet/pointer/presence state.
- `public.mainship_space_resolve_origin(uuid)` — resolves the move origin from current authoritative state.
- `public.mainship_space_assert_cross_domain_exclusion(uuid)` — enforces the legacy/coordinate domain
  mutual exclusion.
All are owned by `postgres`, `set search_path = public`, and relocked so `PUBLIC`/`anon`/`authenticated`
have **no** EXECUTE; `service_role` only. None is exposed as a player-facing PostgREST/RPC function. The
canonical client-RPC grants survived the relock intact; `anon`/`authenticated` cannot CREATE in `public`.

**Authoritative proof (real migration chain, off the shared DB).** A disposable local Supabase stack
applied the actual chain `0001..0056` (`osn3-s2-realchain-proof.yml`). Real concurrent psql sessions
(FIFO-driven, `pg_stat_activity` wait-state + `FOR UPDATE NOWAIT` probes) proved the runtime lock
sequence stage-by-stage (`osn3-s2-realchain-lockorder.sh`), plus blocking vs. skip-lock behavior, the
legacy `fleet_movements` non-locking path, valid/contradictory state fixtures, cross-domain exclusions,
ownership/pointer/presence mismatches, origin resolution, no-mutation (md5 before/after), fixture
cleanup, and runtime REST/RPC denial under `anon`/`authenticated` (`osn3-s2-realchain-perm.sql`,
`-fixtures.sql`, `-rest.sh`). The earlier reduced `postgres:15` stub proof
(`osn3-s2-transition-proof.yml`) is demoted to **supplementary / non-gating**.

**Live read-only spot check (`osn3-s2-live-spotcheck.yml`, run passed).** Method = `migration list` +
`db dump` (corroboration) + an **authoritative direct catalog query** (pure `SELECT`s over
`pg_catalog`/`game_config` + one `count`, via the Supabase pooler `aws-1-ap-southeast-1`) + REST reads.
Confirmed on live: `0056` applied; all four helpers present with approved signatures, `owner=postgres`,
`prosecdef=t`, `search_path=public`, `acl={postgres,service_role}` (no PUBLIC/anon/authenticated EXECUTE);
canonical 13-RPC inventory preserved; `anon` keeps `get_world_map`; no helper authenticated-executable;
schema CREATE denied to client roles; **`mainship_send_enabled=false`**, **`mainship_space_movement_enabled=false`**;
**`main_ship_space_movements` row count = 0**. *Note:* `supabase db dump` is `--no-owner` and lossy for
privileges, so owner/ACL facts come from the direct catalog query (authoritative); the dump only
corroborates presence/`SECURITY DEFINER`/`search_path`. No test users, fixtures, game-state rows,
coordinate movements, or flag changes were created during deployment or verification — strictly read-only.

**Scope confirmation.** S2 added **no** coordinate-movement writer, no coordinate return, no arrival
settlement, no processor/cron, no Stop, no target UI, no public movement RPC, no public grant, no
reconciler, no repair/destruction change, no legacy-writer change, no feature enablement, no frontend
change. **NEXT (not started, awaiting a separate explicit S3 charter):** begin-move RPC (S3) → arrival
processor (S4) → reconciler/destruction hardening (S5) → target UI (S7) → OSN-4 Stop (S8).

## 2026-06-21 — OSN-3 S1: coordinate-domain schema + invariants + read-model — CLOSED (flag OFF)

First **OSN-3** implementation slice (merge commit `90637d6`, branch `osn3-s1-schema-read`, migration
`0055`). **Schema + read-model only — NO movement writers, NO processor, NO UI, NO Stop.** Both flags
stay false (`mainship_send_enabled`, new `mainship_space_movement_enabled`). Builds on OSN-2 (the
durable open-space position model). Five design gates (A → A3.2) preceded it; all blockers resolved.

**Mandatory preflight (proven before deploy).** A disposable `postgres:15` CI container
(`scripts/osn3-s1-trigger-proof.sql` + `osn3-s1-schema-proof.sql`, workflow `osn3-s1-trigger-proof.yml`)
proved, on the real engine but off the shared DB: the `fleets.main_ship_id` **write-once** trigger
(rejects reassignment / late-attach / ordinary detach), that `ON DELETE SET NULL` fires **after** the
parent ship row is gone (so the trigger permits parent-deletion orphaning and existing user/ship
hard-delete cleanup keeps working), and the full §5.1 constraint matrix. *Bug found by the proof:* the
cyclic `fleets ⇄ main_ship_space_movements` FK graph tripped a constraint mid-cascade on a direct ship
delete → fixed by making `fleets.active_space_movement_id` FK **`DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED`**.

**Migration 0055 (additive, transactional).**
- `main_ship_space_movements` — the coordinate route engine, **separate** from frozen `fleet_movements`
  so `process_fleet_movements` can never claim it. `target_kind` ∈ space|location|base with an explicit
  id-iff-kind CHECK; all coords finite + within `[-10000,10000]²`; `speed_used` finite>0; `arrive>depart`;
  status/`resolved_at` integrity; one-active partial-uniques per ship & per fleet; due-arrival index;
  owner-read RLS, no client write; FKs cascade on ship/fleet/user.
- `fleets.active_space_movement_id` (+ FK DEFERRABLE) — the honest moving-fleet pointer; mutual-exclusion
  with `active_movement_id` + requires-moving/movement CHECKs; one-fleet-per-movement unique.
- `main_ship_space_command_receipts` — `UNIQUE(main_ship_id,request_id)` + `canonical_payload_hash`;
  RLS on, **no** client read/write (server-only).
- `main_ship_instances.status += 'stationary'` + six legacy-safe forward lifecycle CHECKs (the reverse
  `stationary` rule uses `… IS TRUE` to reject `stationary`+NULL). No reverse rules for legacy statuses;
  no back-fill (existing rows stay `spatial_state=NULL`).
- write-once `fleets.main_ship_id` trigger; `mainship_space_movement_enabled=false`; execute relock.

**Read-model (the SINGLE resolver, extended — no second resolver).** `resolveMainShipMarker` now reads
the already-deployed coordinate states: `in_transit` (interpolate the active `main_ship_space_movements`
row, fully validated against ship/fleet/pointer/timestamps/presence), `at_location` (validated present
fleet + matching active presence), and `home` (base, no active state). Legacy `NULL` behavior unchanged;
any contradiction → `null`. A new owner-read fetch of the active coordinate movement runs inside the
existing 4s poll; the fleet read gains `location_mode`/`active_movement_id`/`active_space_movement_id`.

**Verification (all green via CI; local toolchain unusable).** Disposable trigger+schema proofs ✓;
branch closure (`npm run lint` + `tsc -b` + `vite build` + resolver unit tests **32/32**) ✓; migration
deploy ✓; phase8 engine regression ✓; live `verify:osn3:s1` **13/13** (both flags false, RLS owner-read,
client writes denied, receipts unreadable, write-once trigger live, **0 coordinate rows**) ✓; live
`spatial_state` distribution **56/56 NULL**. No writer/processor/UI/reconciler/repair/legacy change.
**NEXT (not started):** shared transition boundary → begin-move RPC (S3) → arrival processor (S4) →
reconciler/destruction hardening (S5) → target UI (S7) → OSN-4 Stop (S8). `MAX_COORDINATE_MOVE_DISTANCE`
/ `MAX_COORDINATE_TRAVEL_SECONDS` and the emergency processor-pause contract are deferred to those slices.

## 2026-06-21 — OSN-1 / OSN-2a / OSN-2b (Open-Space Navigation, read side) — CLOSED

Cross-cutting **Open-Space Navigation (OSN)** initiative (see `MAINSHIP_TRANSITION.md` §12). These
stages add the main ship's single position model and a durable open-space coordinate — **read/schema
only, no movement writers yet**. `mainship_send_enabled` stays **false**; engine + legacy paths frozen.
(Builds on the earlier, separately-recorded main-ship transition 10C–10H + direct A→B move, which live
in `MAINSHIP_TRANSITION.md` §7 rather than this log.)

**OSN-1 — read-only main-ship map marker (commit `727388f`).** New pure resolver
`src/features/map/resolveMainShipMarker.ts` (single source of main-ship display position: home→base,
present→location, moving/returning→interpolate active movement clamp 0..1, destroyed→null,
in-flight-without-movement→null no-teleport) + `MainShipMarker.tsx` (pointer-transparent, 1s tick only
while moving) + Playwright unit test. Flag-gated; camera/command paths untouched.

**OSN-2a — durable open-space position SCHEMA (commits `1f844e9`, `9534319`; migration `0054`).** Added
nullable-no-default `main_ship_instances.spatial_state` + `space_x`/`space_y` (double precision) as the
single authoritative owner of a "stopped in open space" coordinate. CHECKs: domain
`NULL|home|at_location|in_transit|in_space|destroyed`; coords both-null-or-both-set; coords present IFF
`in_space`; finite-only (reject NaN/±Inf). **No back-fill** — existing ships stay `spatial_state=NULL`
(legacy; position still from base/fleet/movement/presence). No functions → no relock; RLS/grants
unchanged (owner-read, no client write). `verify:osn2` 23/23. *Bug fixed:* ASI hazard (regex at
statement start) in the verifier (`9534319`).

**OSN-2b — resolver reads the new columns, read-model only (commits `bfebb1f`, `30289fe`, `f400ee4`,
`17ceb51`, `8a9518d`).** Extended the **single** resolver (no second resolver): `in_space`→ship-owned
`space_x/space_y` (finite, no active fleet/presence); `NULL`→legacy, with the named-location path now
deterministic (requires fleet `present` + `current_location_id` + matching ACTIVE `location_presence` +
resolvable location, else null); destroyed/contradiction/other→null. Read-side plumbing only:
`MainShipLite` + owner-read select gain the 3 columns; `fetchActiveMainShipPresence` (narrow: linked
`fleet_id` + `status='active'`, 3 fields, limit 1) runs inside the existing poll; `GalaxyMap` threads
presence into the marker. No writer/migration/RPC/flag/status/reconciler/destruction/lock change.

**Closure verification (commit `8a9518d`).** `@playwright/test` pinned **exactly `1.61.0`** (devDep +
lockfile); resolver test runs via `npm ci` (dropped ad-hoc `npm install --no-save`); on-demand strict
closure workflow runs **full `npm run lint` + `tsc -b` + `vite build` + resolver test**, all green;
read-only `verify:osn2:distribution` confirmed the live distribution is **54/54 `spatial_state=NULL`**
(zero `in_space`/`home`/`at_location`/`in_transit`/`destroyed` — no live ship hidden by the resolver).
*Bugs fixed during closure:* resolver workflow missing Playwright install → exit 127 (`30289fe`);
violet `in_space` marker color reverted — it was `LocationMarker`'s derelict-station color, not main-ship
visual language (`f400ee4`); two pre-existing `Date.now()`-during-render eslint errors
(`MainShipPanel.tsx`, `MainShipMarker.tsx`) fixed via the existing `now`-in-state tick so full repo lint
is green (`17ceb51`).

**Local toolchain note:** the dev machine cannot run lint/tsc/build/playwright locally (OneDrive
`node_modules` corruption + TLS-intercepting proxy); all verification runs in CI. Migrations through
**0054**. **NEXT:** OSN-3 (arbitrary-coordinate movement) — Design Gate A produced; 4 open decisions

## 2026-06-19 — Design correction: HIGH-STAKES ships (destructible) + emergency restart (docs)

**Decision (replaces "never destroyed + self-repair"):** main ships are persistent but **NOT
immortal** — they **can be permanently destroyed** (gone/retired) for real strategic stakes.
**Safelock rule: permanent ship loss is allowed; permanent account lockout is not.** When a
player has **zero usable main ships**, grant **one weak emergency starter ship** (starter hull,
**no modules, no captain bonuses, basic readiness, restart-only**) — does NOT restore the
destroyed ship, does NOT refund resources, gated by **strict eligibility + cooldown** (no farming;
a player with any usable ship is ineligible). Future defeat consequences: destroyed ship lost ·
cargo/rewards lost · modules lost/damaged/salvaged later · captains injured/rescued/captured later
· surviving ships keep going.

**Docs only (`MAINSHIP_TRANSITION.md`):** rewrote §6 anti-softlock to the high-stakes
destructible-ship + emergency-restart model; updated the fix-direction, softlock-coupling note,
§5 model (defeat = possible permanent destruction; surviving ships remain), the ★ vision
(persistent ≠ immortal), §8 residual-softlock (zero-ships → mandatory emergency replacement;
airtight eligibility), §9 (no destruction/replacement in 10C; both ship together in 10E), and the
phase table — **10C stays NON-COMBAT-only (no destruction)**; **10E renamed to destruction &
safelock** (permanent destruction + emergency-replacement RPC).

**Not implemented.** No code, no migration, no combat change. 10C not started (awaiting separate
approval). Backend unchanged.

---

## 2026-06-18 — Design correction: deprecate support capacity / support craft (UI + docs)

**Decision:** support capacity / support craft is **no longer part of the byeharu vision**. The
core is **multiple persistent main ships + captains + modules + upgrades**. Remove support
**safely** (hide → stop depending → delete), not by sudden deletion. This step: **hide from UI +
mark deprecated in docs.** No backend change, no migration, no deletes.

**Docs (`MAINSHIP_TRANSITION.md`):** added a ⚠️ deprecation callout in the ★ vision (support is
dormant scaffolding, not core; loadout = captains/modules/upgrades, no support craft, no
capacity budget); revised the model + 10D wording; added a **"9b. Removing support — later"**
safe-order section (hide → stop depending → deprecate fns → drop schema last).

**UI (10B preview revised → "Main Ship" read-only view):** `MainShipPreview.tsx` now shows the
**main ship only** — name, hull, status, readiness (hp/max_hp), speed, cargo, captain slots,
module slots. **Removed: support-craft picker, support-capacity bar, support-loadout wording,
activity selector.** `mainshipApi.ts` rewritten to read `main_ship_instances` (owner-read) +
`main_ship_hull_types` (public) directly — dropped `fetchSupportCraftTypes` /
`fetchExpeditionPreview` (the support-laden client wrappers). Galaxy toggle relabeled
"🛰 Main Ship". Still strictly read-only; no writes.

**Backend: UNCHANGED.** No migration. `get_my_expedition_preview`, `calculate_expedition_stats`,
`support_craft_types`, and the `support_capacity` columns stay in place but **dormant + unused by
the UI**. (`verify:mainship-preview` still exercises the dormant RPC — left as a backend
regression.) **Remaining support dependencies (to remove in a later phase):** `support_craft_types`
table (Phase 6 + `verify-phase6`); `calculate_expedition_stats` support math (Phase 8) +
`get_my_expedition_preview` wrapper (Phase 10B); `support_capacity`/`base_support_capacity`
columns; a non-displayed `support_capacity` read in `useGalaxyMapData` (Phase 9A). **Recommended
later removal phase:** after the captain/module/upgrade stat source replaces the support layer
and no live path calls it. **Docs + UI only; not pushed; no CI run.**

---

## 2026-06-18 — Phase 10B: read-only main-ship expedition preview (implemented; pending verify)

**Scope: strict preview only** — see what your main ship + a support-craft loadout WOULD bring.
No writes, no sending, no combat/engine change; the Phase 9B send path is untouched. Per
`docs/MAINSHIP_TRANSITION.md` (10B).

**Migration `0049_mainship_preview.sql`** — `get_my_expedition_preview(p_loadout jsonb,
p_activity_type text)` → jsonb. **STABLE (read-only)**, SECURITY DEFINER, `auth.uid()`-scoped,
granted to **authenticated**. Reuses the **single stat source** `calculate_expedition_stats`
(Phase 8, stays server-only — the wrapper calls it as the definer; not exposed to clients).
- Ship exists → `{has_ship:true, valid:true, ship, stats}`.
- Validation errors (over-capacity / unknown craft / bad qty) are **caught** → `{valid:false,
  error}` (a preview warning, not a client crash).
- No ship yet → `{has_ship:false, hull:…}` starter-hull teaser. **It does NOT commission a
  ship** (no write) — commissioning is a later phase.

**Frontend (read-only):** `mainshipApi.ts` (`fetchSupportCraftTypes`, `fetchExpeditionPreview`);
`MainShipPreview.tsx` — a panel with an activity dropdown + capacity-limited support-craft
picker + live stat grid + a `support_capacity` used/limit bar + warnings, labeled **"Preview
only · does not send."** Wired into `/galaxy` behind a header toggle (`🛰 Main Ship preview`),
**separate from the send command** (single send surface preserved).

**Verify:** `scripts/verify-mainship-preview.mjs` (`npm run verify:mainship-preview`,
standalone — NOT wired into the chained verify): base stats · valid loadout (reuses adapter) ·
over-capacity → warning · unknown craft → warning · no-ship hull teaser · **wrote-nothing
proof** (no-ship player still has none) · adapter still client-denied.

**Untouched:** combat/fleet/movement/reward/send/cleanup. No deletes, no renames. Known limit:
to see *loadout* numbers a ship must exist; live players without one see the hull teaser
(commissioning = later phase). Test main-ship rows for `mspreviewtest*` users persist (not a
runtime table; tiny). **Pending build + verify (handed off to user).**

---

## 2026-06-18 — Follow-up: M4.5 browser test self-cleaning + orphan cleanup (test hygiene)

**Why** The M4.5 browser test (`m45browser.*@example.com`, no `"test"`, no cleanup step) left
runtime orphans the guarded `cleanup_test_runtime` couldn't remove (3 rows: 1 fleet + 2
build_orders). Pre-existing, predates the Phase C `%test%` convention; not a 9C change.

**Part A — prevent future:** test email `m45browser.*` → **`m45testbrowser.*@example.com`**;
`browser.yml` gains the shared `live-db-tests` **concurrency group** + an `if: always()`
cleanup step `verify-cleanup --pattern '%m45testbrowser%@example.com'`. That pattern is unique:
it can NOT match verify (`m45test.TAG` / `m*test` / `p*test` / `invtest`) or galaxy
(`galaxytest*`).

**Part B — remove existing orphans:** one-time `scripts/cleanup-m45-orphans.mjs` (+ dispatch
workflow, dry-run default). It collects runtime player_ids, **proves ownership via
`auth.admin.getUserById` (email must match `/^m45browser\./`)**, shows the rows, then deletes
child→parent **only** those players' runtime rows. No TRUNCATE; no guard change; never touches
bases/inventory/main_ship/config/world.

**Result:** dry-run proved **1** orphan player (`m45browser.1781756112790@example.com`) owning
exactly 3 rows (1 completed fleet + 2 terminal build_orders); `--confirm` deleted them
(child→parent). The renamed M4.5 browser run self-cleaned its own 3 rows via `%m45testbrowser%`.
**verify:phase8 ✅ 21/21, galaxy 9A/9B ✅, M4.5 browser ✅** — all test data self-cleans to 0.

**db:counts after = 360, and that is CORRECT (not test junk):** a read-only owner diagnostic
(`scripts/whoami-runtime.mjs` + `runtime-owners.yml`) showed all remaining runtime rows belong
to **ONE REAL player — `gkwngns714@gmail.com`** (the project owner's own manual galaxy-map test:
an expedition to a pirate hunt → 1 fleet + 1 combat encounter, 88 ticks/264 events). **Not
deleted — real player data.** Test infrastructure leftover = **0**. (The 88 ticks mean a verify
run had `combat_tick_logging` on during that combat; it's reset to false by m4/m5's finally and
those ticks age out via Phase B 3-day retention.)

**Net:** M4.5 browser test is now self-cleaning + serialized; old orphans removed; no real/
config/permanent data touched; no TRUNCATE; no gameplay change. **Follow-up CLOSED.**

---

## 2026-06-18 — Phase 9C: Expedition UI Reframe (BUILD + VERIFY + BROWSER GREEN ✅)

**Request** Make the player understand: Galaxy Map = where you send expeditions; Command
Center = status + shortcuts; fleet status area = active/returning/completed. Remove duplicate
send controls. Frontend/copy only — no backend.

**Duplicate removed:** the old in-dashboard `SendFleetPanel` (list-based send) duplicated the
Phase 9B map send → **deleted** (`src/features/fleets/SendFleetPanel.tsx`; only the Dashboard
imported it). `/galaxy` is now the **only** send surface.

**Reframe (frontend only):**
- `ExpeditionLauncher.tsx` (new) — replaces the dashboard send panel with a pointer card:
  "Send your first from the Galaxy Map", a prominent **Open Galaxy Map** button, and the
  reward rule in plain words ("pending while out · secured only on return"). Empty-vs-active
  copy. testid `dashboard-expedition-launcher`.
- `Dashboard.tsx` — swaps `SendFleetPanel` → `ExpeditionLauncher`; header already links to the
  map. No other send control remains.
- `FleetStatusPanel.tsx` — kept the `Fleets` heading + "previous run(s)" wording (m45 selectors)
  but added a subtitle ("Active expeditions — travel, on-station, and returns"), reframed the
  empty state to **"No active expedition. Send your first from the Galaxy Map →"** (links to
  `/galaxy`), and made the status badge **activity-aware** (present + hunt → "Fighting", else
  "On station"). Existing reward wording kept ("rewards locked (secured on arrival)").

**No backend touched** — no migration, no RPC/combat/reward/return/cleanup change, no second
map or send flow. Phase 9B send logic unchanged.

**Tests:** `galaxy9b.spec.ts` gains a check that the Command Center shows
`dashboard-expedition-launcher` and has **no** "Send a fleet" control (single-surface proof).
9A/9B/m45 selectors preserved.

**Result (commit `aaea9d5`):** build/typecheck + lint ✅, Pages deployed. **verify:phase8 ✅
21/21.** **Browser: 9A 1/1, 9B 1/1** (incl. single-send-surface assertion), **M4.5 1/1**
(confirms the FleetStatusPanel reframe kept its selectors). **db:counts runtime = 0.** No
backend/migration/table-write change; `/galaxy` is the only send surface. **Phase 9C CLOSED.**

---

## 2026-06-18 — Phase 9B: Map-based Expedition Send (BUILD + VERIFY + BROWSER GREEN ✅)

**Backend path inspection (done before wiring — no backend change, no migration):**
- **RPC used:** `send_fleet_to_location(p_base uuid, p_location uuid, p_units jsonb)` (migration
  0019), via the existing wrapper `sendFleetToLocation(baseId, locationId, units)` in
  `fleetApi.ts`. This is the same path Phase 8's chain (verify-m4) drives — already verified.
- **Inputs:** base id, location id, `units` = `[{unit_type_id, quantity}]`.
- **Success:** `{ fleet_id, movement_id, arrive_at }`.
- **Failure:** raises → supabase-js returns `error.message`; the wrapper throws it.
- **Backend-authoritative validation (already present):** base owned+active · location valid/
  active · `activity_type ∈ {none, hunt_pirates}` · **active-fleet-limit (max_active_fleets=3,
  counts moving/present/returning)** · units non-empty · units available & positive (via
  `base_reserve_units`, which also *reserves* them so the same units can't be re-sent) · fleet
  power ≥ `min_power_required`. → it already blocks invalid sends, over-limit/duplicate active
  expeditions, insufficient units, and invalid/locked destinations. **No second expedition
  system created.**

**Implementation (frontend only):**
- `useGalaxyMapData.ts` — additionally loads `unitTypes` (catalog, static) + `baseUnits`
  (polled) so the command area can offer a loadout. Still read-only fetches.
- `ExpeditionCommand.tsx` (new) — replaces the disabled 9A placeholder. Compact unit picker +
  Send → **confirmation step** → calls `sendFleetToLocation` **exactly once** (synchronous
  `sendingRef` guard + `sending` state → double-submit-proof). Shows sending / success / error
  states + a disabled reason. **No optimistic movement** — on success it calls the hook's
  `refresh()`; the movement line appears only from refetched `movements`.
- `GalaxyMapScreen.tsx` — wires the command area into the detail panel; passes base/units/
  unitTypes; `onSent` → refresh.
- `LocationMarker.tsx` — adds `data-activity` / `data-location-id` (test selectors). `FleetMovementLine.tsx` — adds `data-testid="galaxy-movement-line"`.
- **Frontend-only checks (clarity, not authority):** no destination / non-dispatchable
  activity / no units selected / already sending → disabled with a reason. Everything real
  (ownership, limits, units, power, validity) stays backend-authoritative; backend errors are
  surfaced verbatim.

**No direct table writes from the UI** — the only write is the approved `send_fleet_to_location`
RPC. No combat/reward/return/cleanup/logging logic touched.

**Tests:** `galaxy.spec.ts` updated (9A read-only smoke kept; send button asserted disabled
before a loadout). `galaxy9b.spec.ts` (new) — select a dispatchable marker → pick units → send
→ confirm (double-clicked) → success → assert **exactly one** fleet+movement via backend read
→ movement line on map → no dup from double-submit → send disabled before units → no console
errors. `browser-galaxy.yml` runs both then `verify:cleanup` (test email contains `test` so
`cleanup_test_runtime` removes its runtime rows → db:counts back to 0).

**Result (commit `aefd5ea`):** build/typecheck ✅ (lint clean after remount-via-key + CSS
cursor fixes), Pages deployed. **verify:phase8 ✅ 21/21 … M4 40/40** (run alone). **Browser:
9A smoke 1/1, 9B send 1/1.** **db:counts runtime = 0** (galaxy cleanup scoped to
`%galaxytest%`). **Transient verify failure root-caused + fixed:** I'd dispatched the browser
suite + verify concurrently; the browser workflow's broad `%test%` cleanup deleted verify's
in-flight phase5 fleet mid-combat → "no wave cleared". Fixed: shared `live-db-tests`
concurrency group on both workflows + galaxy cleanup narrowed to `%galaxytest%` (can't touch
verify's m*/p* users). Re-run verify alone = 21/21. **No backend/migration/table-write/second-
expedition-system added.** **Phase 9B CLOSED.**

---

## 2026-06-18 — Phase 9A: Read-only Visual Galaxy Map (BUILD + VERIFY GREEN ✅)

**Request** First visual galaxy map screen — read-only, using existing backend world data.
See the world/locations/home/ship/active movements; select a location for details. No
commands, no writes, no backend change.

**No backend change needed.** All data already exists: `get_world_map()` (sectors→zones→
locations with x,y), `bases` (x,y,name), `fleet_movements` (**origin_x/y + target_x/y** stored
→ paths drawable directly), `location_state` (pressure/danger), `main_ship_instances`
(owner-read). Confirmed before building; **no migration added**.

**Files (all `src/features/map/`, matching the existing feature structure):**
- `useGalaxyMapData.ts` — read-only hook: world map + base once; polls movements + location
  states + a small `main_ship_instances` owner-read every 4s. Builds location→sector/zone meta.
- `GalaxyMap.tsx` — plain **SVG** 2D map (no canvas/WebGL). Normalizes world coords into a
  0..1000 viewBox; transform group gives pan (drag) + zoom (wheel/+/−/reset). Renders movement
  paths, home/ship anchor, and location markers. Labels hidden when zoomed out.
- `LocationMarker.tsx` — colored marker + truncated label, counter-scaled to stay constant
  on-screen size; selecting only highlights.
- `FleetMovementLine.tsx` — dashed origin→target path (amber outbound / sky return) + ETA
  (`formatCountdown`). Purely visual.
- `GalaxyMapScreen.tsx` — page with loading / error / empty / selection states + a **read-only
  detail panel** (name, sector/zone, type, coords, status, difficulty/reward, live world
  state) + a disabled “Send expedition (Phase 9B)” button + “coming in Phase 9B” note.
- `fleetTypes.ts` — additive: `origin_x/y`, `target_x/y` (already returned by `select('*')`).
- `App.tsx` — new `/galaxy` route (RequireAuth). Nav links added from Dashboard + MapPage.

**Read-only guarantees:** the screen calls only read paths (`get_world_map`, table selects on
`location_state`/`fleets`/`fleet_movements`/`main_ship_instances`). No RPC mutation, no
`send_fleet`, no table writes. Action-implying controls are disabled/labeled Phase 9B.

**Result (commit `c1de252`):** frontend **build/typecheck ✅** (`tsc -b && vite build`), **Pages
deployed** (`/galaxy` live), **verify:phase8 ✅** (Phase 8 21/21 … M4 40/40; frontend can't
affect backend). db:counts unaffected (auto-cleanup ran). Manual interactive browser check
not runnable from the dev sandbox (no GUI/network) — offered a Playwright smoke test as
follow-up. **Phase 9A code complete + CI-green.** Phase 9B: click-to-select destination +
expedition send.

**Follow-up — Playwright /galaxy smoke (commit `6d84d19`):** `tests/galaxy.spec.ts` signs in,
opens `/galaxy`, asserts the map + ≥1 marker render, selecting a marker opens the read-only
detail panel, the Send button is **disabled + Phase-9B**, and **no fleet/movement is created**
(read-only proof), failing on serious console/page errors. Stable testids added
(`galaxy-map-screen/-loading/-error`, `galaxy-location-marker`, `galaxy-location-detail-panel`,
`galaxy-send-expedition-disabled`). `verify:galaxy:browser` script + `browser-galaxy.yml`
dispatch. **Result: smoke 1/1 ✅, build ✅, verify:phase8 ✅ (21/21 … M4 40/40), db:counts
runtime = 0.** No backend/migration/write change.

---

## 2026-06-18 — Prevention Phase C: self-cleaning verify runs (DEPLOYED + VERIFIED ✅)

**Request** Stop verify runs leaving runtime/test rows behind. Minimal + safe; no gameplay/
combat/reward/movement/report changes; no TRUNCATE; no real/config/permanent data touched.

**How test data is identified (no `test_run_id` added):** every verify script signs up
throwaway users with emails matching `%test%@example.com` (m4test/m5test/m45test/invtest/
p4test…p8test), and every runtime table carries `player_id`. So verify-created runtime rows =
rows owned by a test-email player. The email pattern is the cleanup key — the existing
convention made a schema column unnecessary.

**Migration `0048_cleanup_test_runtime.sql`:** `cleanup_test_runtime(p_pattern default
'%test%@example.com', p_dry_run default true)` → returns `(table_name, rows_matched,
rows_deleted, cleanup_key)`. Deletes ONLY the 9 runtime tables (+ fleet_units) for test-email
players, child→parent. Guards: pattern MUST contain `test` (else raises); **never** touches
`auth.users`, `bases`, `base_units`, `base_resources`, `player_inventory`, `inventory_ledger`,
`main_ship_instances`, `*_types`, `game_config`, or world tables. No TRUNCATE. SECURITY
DEFINER, service_role only.

**Files:** migration 0048; `scripts/verify-cleanup.mjs` (`verify:cleanup:dry-run` /
`verify:cleanup --confirm`, optional `--pattern`); `package.json`; `verify-phase8.mjs` prints
a cleanup reminder at the end; `verify.yml` adds a final `if: always()` **auto-cleanup step**
so every CI verify removes its own test data (even on failure).

**Result (commit `2ac700f`):** migration 0048 deployed ✅. verify:phase8 ✅ (Phase 8 21/21 …
M4 40/40). Auto-cleanup deleted **728 runtime rows** (matched == deleted every table — the
whole accumulated test backlog + this run). `db:counts` after: **all 10 runtime tables = 0**.
No TRUNCATE; no auth.users/bases/inventory/main_ship/config/world touched. **Phase C CLOSED —
prevention complete (A logging controls · B retention cleanup · C self-cleaning verify).**

---

## 2026-06-18 — Prevention Phase B: safe retention cleanup (DEPLOYED + VERIFIED ✅)

**Request** Add a batched, dry-run-first retention cleanup. No TRUNCATE, no destructive
reset, no active/seeded/player-owned data touched.

**Schema reconciliation (inspected, not assumed) — reported deviations:**
- `combat_ticks` has **`resolved_at`**, not `created_at` → index + rule use `resolved_at`.
- `fleet_movements` has **no `updated_at`** → index + rule use `resolved_at` (set on resolve).
- `reward_grants` has **`granted_at`**, not `claimed_at` → use `granted_at`. (There is no
  "pending"/"claimed" state in this table — a grant row IS an already-secured deposit; pending
  rewards live on `combat_encounters`/`fleet_movements` jsonb and are untouched.)

**Cascade hazard (inspected):** ON DELETE CASCADE roots everything at `fleets`
(→ fleet_units, fleet_movements, location_presence, combat_encounters → ticks/events/reports;
presence → encounters too). Since `combat_reports` (30d) hangs under encounters/presence/
fleets, deleting any ancestor would cascade-delete a still-retained report. So **encounters,
location_presence, and fleets are additionally gated**: never deleted while they have an
ACTIVE encounter or a RETAINED (<30d) report. Net: those three are effectively kept until
their report expires; non-combat presence (no report) still cleans at 1 day.

**Migration `0047_runtime_retention_cleanup.sql`:**
- 10 indexes (`CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`) on the real scan columns (3 substituted per above).
- `maintenance_cleanup_runtime_data(dry_run boolean default true, batch_limit int default 5000)`
  → returns `(table_name, retention_rule, rows_matched, rows_deleted, dry_run)` per table.
  Batched deletes via `ctid in (… limit batch_limit)` loops — never one-shot, never TRUNCATE.
  Kill-switch: if `runtime_cleanup_enabled=false`, forced to dry-run. SECURITY DEFINER,
  service_role only.
- Retention: ticks 3d, events 7d, reports 30d, encounters terminal>14d(+guard), presence
  terminal>1d(+guard), movements terminal>14d, fleet_units (parent terminal>14d), fleets
  terminal>14d(+guard), reward_grants 30d, build_orders terminal>30d.
- Safety: only TERMINAL statuses deleted (active/retreating/moving/waiting/queued never
  match); active encounters/fleets/movements/rewards/builds never deleted; no bases/
  base_resources/base_units/inventory/main_ship/_types/game_config/world tables referenced.

**Files:** migration 0047; `scripts/db-cleanup.mjs` (`db:cleanup:dry-run` / `db:cleanup
--confirm`); `package.json`; `.github/workflows/db-cleanup.yml` (dispatch; dry-run default,
deletes only on confirm=true; shows size/counts before+after).

**Fix during deploy:** first push failed 42P13 — input param `dry_run` collided with the OUT
column `dry_run`; renamed inputs to `p_dry_run`/`p_batch_limit` (project `p_`-convention),
OUT column stays `dry_run`. **Result (commit `dac35a1`):** migration 0047 deployed ✅.
**Dry-run: 0 matched across all 10 tables** (all data fresh — nothing past the 3/7/14/30-day
cutoffs); **live run (confirm=true): 0 matched / 0 deleted** — delete path executes cleanly,
nothing destructive. **verify:phase8 ✅ — Phase 8 21/21 … M4 40/40** (indexes + function did
not affect combat/regression). **Phase B CLOSED.** Next: Phase C (self-cleaning verify runs).

---

## 2026-06-18 — Prevention Phase A: combat logging controls + DB visibility (DEPLOYED + VERIFIED ✅)

**Request** Stop byeharu re-filling the disk: make high-volume combat logging opt-in and add
size/row visibility. No deletes (that's Phase B), no combat-outcome changes.

**Migration `0046_combat_logging_controls.sql`:**
- `cfg_bool(key)` accessor + `set_game_config(key, value jsonb)` (service_role/CI only).
- 7 `game_config` flags (insert-if-absent): `combat_debug_logging=false`,
  `combat_tick_logging=false`, `combat_event_logging=true`, `runtime_cleanup_enabled=true`,
  `combat_tick_retention_days=3`, `combat_event_retention_days=7`, `combat_report_retention_days=30`.
- `process_combat_ticks` (same combat math) now **gates logging**: all `combat_ticks` inserts
  behind `combat_tick_logging` (default OFF → no per-tick rows); per-unit `hull_damage` events
  behind `combat_debug_logging` (default OFF → kills the worst per-tick multiplier); other
  meaningful events behind `combat_event_logging` (default ON → UI animation + reports intact).
  `v_seq` still advances so display ordering is unchanged.
- `db_table_sizes()` (top-20 by `pg_total_relation_size`) + `db_runtime_counts()` (10 runtime
  tables) — service_role only.

**Default logging after this change:** per combat tick we now write **0** `combat_ticks` rows
and **0** `hull_damage` events (was 1 tick + N hull_damage); only milestone/animation events
(wave_spawned, missile_salvo, laser_burst, unit_destroyed, explosion, retreat) remain.
`combat_reports` (player-facing summary) untouched.

**Regression compatibility:** verify-m4 + verify-m5 inspect `combat_ticks`, so they flip
`combat_tick_logging` on via `set_game_config` at start and **restore it off in finally**
(shared DB → production default stays off). Only those two scripts read ticks.

**Visibility:** `scripts/db-size.mjs` (`npm run db:size`) + `scripts/db-counts.mjs`
(`npm run db:counts`), plus a `db-report.yml` dispatch workflow to run both in CI.

**Restrictions honored:** no TRUNCATE, no deletes, no seeded/config/world/player tables
touched.

**Result (commit `e3d0ba4`):** migration 0046 deployed ✅. `db:size` + `db:counts` work
(post-cleanup DB tiny — largest table 120 kB; 240 total runtime rows). **verify:phase8 ✅ —
Phase 8 21/21, Phase 7 18/18, Phase 6 10/10, Phase 5 25/25, Phase 4 16/16, Inventory 18/18,
M4.5 27/27, M5 28/28, M4 40/40** (incl. "waves last 3+ ticks" — m4/m5 tick-toggle works).
**Phase A CLOSED.** Next: Phase B (retention cleanup function, dry-run first).

---

## 2026-06-18 — Phase 8: calculate_expedition_stats() (DEPLOYED + VERIFIED ✅)

**Request** Build the deterministic stat ADAPTER that will eventually turn Main Ship +
Support Craft (+ later Captains + Modules) + Activity into final expedition stats — the
bridge between the new main-ship model and the proven engine. **Read/compute only**; no
mutation; engine unchanged; live combat still uses the old fleet-stack path.

**Migration `0044_calculate_expedition_stats.sql`** — one function,
`calculate_expedition_stats(p_player, p_main_ship_id, p_loadout jsonb, p_activity_type)`
returns jsonb. SECURITY DEFINER, **STABLE (read-only)**, **service_role only**:
- Reads the owned `main_ship_instances` row (+ `main_ship_hull_types` for base_speed); errors
  if the ship isn't found/owned. Validates `activity_type ∈ {pirate_hunt, trade_run,
  exploration, mining, none}`.
- Normalizes the support loadout: **combines duplicate** craft ids; **rejects** unknown
  types, and non-positive / non-integer / NaN / Inf quantities.
- **Enforces `support_capacity` as a HARD cap** — `used = Σ(qty × capacity_cost)`; over the
  ship limit → rejected. This is the anti-unlimited-stacking mechanism (never a plain sum).
- Effects (conservative, linear within the cap) derive from each craft's Phase-6
  `base_stats_json` (attack→combat_power, defense→survival, repair, cargo, scan→scouting,
  mining→mining_yield, evasion→retreat_safety) plus role rules for `pirate_attention`
  (combat_damage/cargo +2, heavy_cargo +4) and a speed penalty (combat_damage 0.05,
  heavy_cargo 0.08, extraction 0.02). Non-useful-for-activity craft add a non-fatal warning.
- Returns normalized, **clamped (≥0), rounded** stats: support_capacity_used/limit, speed,
  cargo_capacity, combat_power, survival, retreat_safety, scouting, mining_yield, repair,
  pirate_attention, warnings[] — **never NaN, never negative, deterministic**.

**Read/compute only (verified):** mutates nothing — ship row + inventory unchanged after many
calls; no fleets/combat/rewards/ranking/reports touched. **NOT wired into live combat** — the
fleet-stack path still owns outcomes (M2–M5 untouched). Support-craft OWNERSHIP isn't
implemented yet, so Phase 8 validates **type/capacity/math** against `support_craft_types`
only; ownership consumption comes when loadouts attach to real expeditions.

**Anti-cheat:** new function default-grants to PUBLIC on create → re-ran the lockdown
(revoke; re-grant the 8 client RPCs; `calculate_expedition_stats` → service_role only). A
client preview RPC (auth.uid()-scoped) will arrive with the Phase 9 UI.

**Boundaries/docs:** SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES decision #8 (table-less read/compute adapter, mutates
nothing). ROADMAP Phase 8 ✅. ARCHITECTURE Phase 8 note. ACTIVITIES: documented which stats
each activity will read from the adapter later.

**Verify:** `scripts/verify-phase8.mjs` — base stats on empty loadout (0/10, speed 1, cargo
50); mixed loadout capacity (7/10); reject over-capacity / unknown / zero / negative /
non-integer; duplicate-combine; per-craft effects (missile_boat→combat+attention/speed,
cargo_drone→cargo+attention, survey→scouting, mining→yield, decoy→retreat, repair→repair+
survival); no-NaN; determinism; ship + inventory not mutated; client-denied; then chains
`verify-phase7` (full regression). CI runs `verify:phase8`.

**Status (commit `5a4c954`):** Migration 0044 **deployed ✅** (direct-Postgres push succeeded).
**Verification BLOCKED by a Supabase infra issue, not code:** every REST/RPC request returns
`upstream request timeout` — including a trivial read of the public `main_ship_hull_types`
table (which touches no Phase 8 code), persisting 13+ min across two runs. The REST/PostgREST
layer is globally unresponsive (DB accepts direct connections — deploy worked — but the API
gateway times out). Needs the Supabase project checked/restarted (paused / compute-exhausted /
stuck schema reload), then re-run `verify:phase8`.

**Resolution:** free-tier disk was full (combat-log churn from dozens of verify runs).
Cleared via one-time migration `0045_dev_cleanup_churn` (TRUNCATE of 10 throwaway runtime/log
tables over the working direct-Postgres connection — user-authorized), then a dashboard
**project restart** bounced the stuck PostgREST. **Verify ✅ — Phase 8 21/21, Phase 7 18/18,
Phase 6 10/10, Phase 5 25/25, Phase 4 16/16, Inventory 18/18, M4.5 27/27, M5 28/28, M4 40/40.
Phase 8 CLOSED.** Follow-up: Phases A–C add logging controls + safe retention cleanup + self-
cleaning verify so the disk can't fill again.

## 2026-06-18 — Phase 7: Main Ship Instance (DEPLOYED + VERIFIED ✅)

**Request** Create the player's ONE main ship — the player identity, not stackable, one
active per player. Additive foundation only: no combat hook, no support-craft attachment, no
`calculate_expedition_stats`, no capacity enforcement. Engine untouched.

**Migration `0043_main_ship_instance.sql`** — two tables + three server-only functions:
- `main_ship_hull_types` (Reference/Config, public-read): one starter hull `starter_frigate`
  — base_hp 500, base_speed 1.0, cargo 50, **support_capacity 10**, captain_slots 2,
  module_slots 3. (Conservative; not final balance.)
- `main_ship_instances` (Main Ship system, owner-read, **no client write**): `player_id`
  UNIQUE (one per player), hull FK, name default 'Byeharu', `status` CHECK in the 10 allowed
  states (default `home`), hp/max_hp/cargo_used/cargo_capacity/support_capacity/captain_slots/
  module_slots with `>=0`/`>0` checks. Stats are copied from the hull on creation so the
  instance can later diverge (damage/upgrades) without mutating the template.
- `ensure_main_ship_for_player(player)` — idempotent, concurrency-safe via the `player_id`
  UNIQUE (`on conflict do nothing` → select) → one ship per player. `get_main_ship(player)`
  read helper. `rename_main_ship(player,name)` — trims, rejects empty + >40 chars, requires an
  existing ship. All SECURITY DEFINER, **service_role only** (clients read their ship via
  owner-read RLS; no client mutation/RPC path).

**What did NOT change (by design):** combat, fleets, `fleet_movements`, presence, production/
build queue, rewards, inventory, support_craft metadata. No fleet-table renames. Player-
creation path (`initialize_new_player`) untouched — the ship is created on demand via
`ensure_main_ship_for_player` (a future bootstrap/RPC will call it). Anti-cheat: new functions
default-grant to PUBLIC → re-ran the lockdown (revoke; re-grant the 8 client RPCs; ensure/get/
rename → service_role). Prior service_role grants untouched.

**Boundaries/docs:** `main_ship_hull_types` added to Reference/Config; new **Main Ship** owner
row (sole writer of `main_ship_instances`) + per-system contract + ownership decision #7.
ROADMAP Phase 7 ✅. ARCHITECTURE Phase 7 note (ship exists, doesn't drive expeditions yet).

**Verify:** `scripts/verify-phase7.mjs` — starter hull public-read + client-write-blocked;
ensure creates exactly one ship (idempotent, no dup); owner-read + cross-user RLS; client
INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE + server-RPCs all blocked; stats valid & copied from hull; status
defaults `home`; rename trims + rejects empty/overlong/no-ship; then chains `verify-phase6`
(full regression) to prove the engine is unchanged. CI runs `verify:phase7`.

**Result (commit `05b1cc5`):** Deploy ✅ · Build ✅ · Pages ✅ · Verify ✅ —
**Phase 7 18/18, Phase 6 10/10, Phase 5 25/25, Phase 4 16/16, Inventory 18/18, M4.5 27/27,
M5 28/28, M4 40/40** (M2 11 / M3 13 chained), 0 failed. Ship created hp 500/500, support 10,
captain 2, module 3, status `home`; idempotent; client writes + server RPCs blocked. Migration
0043 live on `dlkbwztrdvnnjlvaydut`. **Phase 7 CLOSED.**

---

## 2026-06-18 — Phase 6: Support Craft Reframe (DEPLOYED + VERIFIED ✅)

**Request** Reframe "build ships" toward the future "build support craft / expedition
equipment" model — **metadata foundation only**, no engine change. Support craft must be
**capacity-limited loadout choices, not unlimited additive power**. No instances, no
expedition attachment, no `calculate_expedition_stats`, no capacity enforcement yet.

**Migration `0042_support_craft_types.sql`** — one Reference/Config table (mirrors
`item_types`): `support_craft_type_id` PK, name, role, `capacity_cost int check (>0)`,
stackable, buildable, `activity_tags jsonb`, `tradeoffs_json`, `base_stats_json`. Public-read
RLS, **no write policy / no write grant → clients cannot mutate**. Seeds the **8 starter
craft** with real roles + capacity costs + tradeoffs:
- scout_escort (light_escort, cap 1) · missile_boat (combat_damage, cap 3) · repair_drone
  (repair, cap 2) · cargo_drone (cargo, cap 2) · survey_drone (scanning, cap 2) · decoy_drone
  (retreat_safety, cap 1) · mining_drone (extraction, cap 2) · trade_barge (heavy_cargo, cap 5).
- `base_stats_json` is illustrative only — **nothing consumes it yet** (Phase 8).

**What did NOT change (by design):** combat (`unit_types` scout/corvette/frigate untouched,
separate namespace), the serial build queue / `build_orders` / `train_units`, fleets,
movement, rewards, inventory. No fleet-table renames. No new functions (so no execute-lockdown
needed). Frontend wording left as-is to avoid risking the M4.5 browser acceptance; the
build-queue reframe is conceptual/documented (M4.5 = Serial Build Queue Foundation; ARCHITECTURE
+ SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES updated).

**Boundaries/docs:** `support_craft_types` added to the Reference/Config sole-writer row;
new ownership decision #6 (metadata only, capacity enforced later by main ship +
`calculate_expedition_stats`). ROADMAP Phase 6 ✅. ARCHITECTURE Phase 6 note.

**Verify:** `scripts/verify-phase6.mjs` — 8 definitions exist & public-read; capacity_cost > 0
matching documented costs; every craft has role + activity_tags + tradeoffs; zero overlap with
combat `unit_types` (engine untouched); client INSERT/UPDATE blocked by RLS; then chains
`verify-phase5` (→ phase4 → inventory → m45 → m5 → m2/m3/m4) to prove combat + serial queue
unchanged. CI runs `verify:phase6`.

**Result (commit `4038209`):** Deploy ✅ · Build ✅ · Pages ✅ · Verify ✅ —
**Phase 6 10/10, Phase 5 25/25, Phase 4 16/16, Inventory 18/18, M4.5 27/27, M5 28/28,
M4 40/40** (M2 11 / M3 13 chained), 0 failed. 8 craft seeded, capacity 1–5, client writes
blocked, zero overlap with combat unit_types. Migration 0042 live on `dlkbwztrdvnnjlvaydut`.
**Phase 6 CLOSED.**

---

## 2026-06-18 — Phase 5: Multi-Item Pirate Loot (DEPLOYED + VERIFIED ✅)

**Request** Pirate combat should accrue real item drops alongside metal — a controlled
combat-reward DATA change, not an engine rewrite. Reuse the proven Phase 4 bundle; keep the
reward timing law; metal stays in `base_resources`; server-authoritative loot only. No
crafting/modules/captains/UI.

**Migration `0041_pirate_loot.sql`** — two isolated, server-only helpers + a 3-line injection
into the existing combat tick:
- `pirate_loot_for_wave(p_wave int, p_danger numeric)` — the loot table. **Deterministic**
  (no RNG → stable tests), small/clamped, **only Phase-3-seeded ids**: scrap (every wave),
  pirate_alloy (≥3), weapon_parts (≥5), engine_parts (≥8), repair_parts (≥10). `p_danger`
  reserved for future scaling; v1 keeps qty=1 so survival can't make loot explode. Returns
  `[]` below wave 1 (no NaN, no unknown ids).
- `loot_merge_items(a, b)` — combines two items[] by id (summed) to keep the accumulated
  bundle tidy across waves. (reward_grant also de-dups on deposit — belt & suspenders.)
- `process_combat_ticks` (copied verbatim from 0030) gains exactly three PHASE-5 lines:
  declare `v_loot_items`; on wave-clear set `v_loot_items := pirate_loot_for_wave(wave,danger)`
  and put it in `reward_delta`; merge `items[]` into `total_rewards_json` next to the
  accumulated metal. Everything else — carry-home, retreat, defeat-forfeit (`'{}'`),
  secured-on-arrival — is unchanged.

**Reward flow (all unchanged from Phase 4):** drops are pending in `total_rewards_json` →
ride `reward_payload_json` home → `reward_grant` on arrival splits metal→`base_resources`,
items→`player_inventory` (idempotent). Defeat clears the bundle → forfeits metal AND items.
Retreat alone never secures.

**Boundaries/docs:** `ACTIVITIES.md` pirate_hunt loot section made concrete (server-side
only; rare progression ids reserved). Combat still owns only its reward accrual — it writes
the pending bundle, never Inventory/Base directly. Frontend unchanged (no client loot path).

**Anti-cheat:** new helpers default-grant to PUBLIC on create → 0041 re-runs the lockdown
(revoke from public/anon/authenticated, re-grant the 8 client RPCs; loot helpers → service_role
for CI only). reward_grant/inventory_* service_role grants untouched.

**Verify:** `scripts/verify-phase5.mjs` — (A) deterministic loot-table + merge helpers
(positive ints, known ids, clamped, dedup), (B) **real combat**: items appear in
`total_rewards_json`, stay pending through retreat, deposit to `player_inventory` +
`base_resources` on home arrival, report keeps metal; (C) **defeat** forfeits metal+items;
(D) chains `verify-phase4` (→ inventory → m45 → m5 → m2/m3/m4). CI runs `verify:phase5`.

**Result (commit `bf32dbf`):** Deploy ✅ · Build ✅ · Pages ✅ · Verify ✅ —
**Phase 5 25/25, Phase 4 16/16, Inventory 18/18, M4.5 27/27, M5 28/28, M4 40/40** (M2 11 /
M3 13 chained), 0 failed. Real run banked metal +38 and scrap +1 on arrival; defeat forfeited
the bundle. Migration 0041 live on `dlkbwztrdvnnjlvaydut`. **Phase 5 CLOSED.**

---

## 2026-06-17 — Phase 4: Pending Loot Bundle (DEPLOYED + VERIFIED ✅)

**Request** Generalize the metal-only pending reward into a future-proof
`PendingRewardBundle { metal?, items:[{item_id,quantity}] }`. Backend plumbing only — no
new pirate drops, no trading/mining/crafting/UI. Keep the reward timing law exactly:
pending while travelling · secured **once on home arrival** · forfeited on defeat · retreat
doesn't secure. Metal stays in `base_resources`; items go to `player_inventory`.

**Key finding (no schema change needed).** The pending bundle already rides existing jsonb
columns end-to-end: combat accrues → `combat_encounters.total_rewards_json` → (on exit)
`fleet_movements.reward_payload_json` (via `movement_attach_cargo`) → (on arrival)
`reward_grant('combat', encounter, player, base, bundle)`. So Phase 4 is a **single
function change** — additive, no new column, no rename.

**Migration `0040_pending_loot_bundle.sql`** — rewrites `reward_grant()` (the secured-
deposit owner) to **split the bundle**:
- metal (and any scalar resource) → `Base.base_add_resources(p_rewards - 'items')`. The
  `- 'items'` strip is essential: `base_add_resources` casts every jsonb value to double and
  would choke on the items array.
- items[] → `Inventory.inventory_deposit(player, item, qty, key)` with key
  `'<source_type>:<source_id>:<item_id>'`.
- **Idempotency:** metal guarded by `reward_grants` UNIQUE(source_type,source_id) (one
  grant/source, early-return on replay) **plus** the inventory ledger key — both metal and
  items double-deposit-proof across cron retry / reprocessing.
- **Fail-safe validation:** items deduped by id (quantities summed), filtered to positive
  integers `< 1e9` (rejects negative/zero/NaN/Infinity); unknown item ids skipped with a
  logged `WARNING`; per-item + outer exception isolation so one bad entry never forfeits the
  metal or the valid items.
- Anti-cheat: `create or replace` preserves the 0039 client-revoke; added
  `grant execute … reward_grant … to service_role` (server/CI only, never clients) so the
  verifier can drive it — mirrors `inventory_deposit` / `process_build_queue`.

**Boundaries:** `SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` — Reward now splits the bundle (sole caller of
`base_add_resources`; calls `Inventory.inventory_deposit` for items). Call graph stays
acyclic (Reward → Base, Reward → Inventory). Combat/movement unchanged; combat still accrues
**metal only** (no new drops — that's Phase 5). Reports keep `total_rewards_json` (metal
display intact; items ride along for free, display deferred).

**Verify:** `scripts/verify-phase4.mjs` — drives `reward_grant` directly as service_role
(metal-only · metal+items · idempotent re-grant · per-source key · unknown-item-safe ·
duplicate-combine · negative/zero/NaN-skip · empty-bundle no-op · client-denied) then chains
the regression (`verify-inventory` → m45 → m5 → m2/m3/m4) which proves the end-to-end timing
law (defeat forfeits, retreat doesn't secure, reports keep metal). CI `verify.yml` now runs
`verify:phase4`.

**Result (commit `4e1d7eb`):** Deploy ✅ · Build ✅ · Pages ✅ · Verify ✅ —
**Phase 4 16/16, Inventory 18/18, M4.5 27/27, M5 28/28, M4 40/40** (M2 11 / M3 13 chained),
0 failed. Migration 0040 live on `dlkbwztrdvnnjlvaydut`. **Phase 4 CLOSED.**

---

## 2026-06-17 — Phase 3: generic inventory foundation (DEPLOYED + VERIFIED ✅)

**Request** Clean generic item inventory for future rewards/materials. Metal stays in
`base_resources` (untouched); a future loot bundle deposits metal → base_resources, items →
player_inventory. No trading/mining/crafting/etc.

**Migration `0039_inventory.sql`:**
- `item_types` (Reference/Config, public read) + 10 starter items (scrap, ore, crystal,
  pirate_alloy, weapon_parts, engine_parts, repair_parts, captain_memory_shard,
  blueprint_fragment, artifact_core).
- `player_inventory` (PK `(player_id,item_id)`, `quantity >= 0`) — **owner-read RLS, no client
  write**. `inventory_ledger` (audit + `unique(idempotency_key)`) — owner-read.
- Functions (SECURITY DEFINER, server-only): `inventory_deposit(player,item,qty,key?)`
  (validates item+qty, upserts, **idempotent via the ledger key**), `inventory_spend`
  (transactional `FOR UPDATE`, rejects insufficient, **never negative**),
  `inventory_get_balance`. Lockdown re-grant (clients unchanged; inventory_* → service_role).

**Boundaries:** new **Inventory** system owns `player_inventory`+`inventory_ledger`;
`item_types` = Reference/Config. Metal/`base_resources` **untouched**; combat/movement/
world-state/reward unchanged.

**Verify:** `scripts/verify-inventory.mjs` (11 tests: seed, owner-read, cross-user RLS,
client-cannot-mutate, deposit-adds, idempotent deposit, spend-subtracts, insufficient,
no-negative, unknown-item, regression). CI `verify.yml` now runs `verify:inventory` (chains
M4.5 → M5 → M2/M3/M4).

**Result (commit `49cc946`):** Deploy ✅ · Build ✅ · Pages ✅ · Verify ✅ —
**Inventory 18/18, M4.5 27/27, M5 28/28, M4 40/40** (M2/M3 chained green), 0 failed.
Migration 0039 live on `dlkbwztrdvnnjlvaydut`. **Phase 3 CLOSED.**

---

## 2026-06-17 — Phase 2: Expedition Activity Architecture (design doc only)

**Request** Define the clean activity abstraction so future gameplay types plug into the
Expedition Engine without spaghetti. Docs only — no code, no migrations, no `src/`.

**Work:** new **`docs/ACTIVITIES.md`** covering the 10 required items —
`ExpeditionActivityType` (pirate_hunt / trade_run / exploration / mining, mapped to the
existing `activity_type` enum placeholders); shared lifecycle owned by the Engine (travel ·
arrival · presence · dispatch · pending-reward accrual · return · secured-on-arrival deposit ·
status · reports); per-activity ownership table; the **Activity Handler contract**
(`<activity>_create` + `process_<activity>_ticks` cron + optional `_request_leave` +
Engine.finish) — grounded in the existing `activity_start` router + the Combat precedent;
`PendingRewardBundle` (`{ metal?, items[] }`); history-only report/result shape; "add an
activity = enum value + handler + one dispatch line + one panel" (no giant switch); the
anti-spaghetti call graph (`activity → pending → secure-on-return → inventory → progression →
ranking`); explicit non-goals; acceptance criteria.

**No code / migrations / `src/` changes.** ROADMAP Phase 2 marked done → ACTIVITIES.md.
M2 11/11 · M3 13/13 · M4 40/40 · M4.5 27/27 unaffected (nothing executable changed). **Next:**
Phase 3 (generic inventory) when chosen.

---

## 2026-06-17 — Phase 1: roadmap / architecture reconciliation (docs only)

**Request** After M4.5, make the docs match the real game direction — **main-ship expedition
game**. Documentation only; no gameplay code; M2/M3/M4/M4.5 stay green.

**Work (docs only):**
- **New `docs/ROADMAP.md`** — the authoritative forward direction: final identity (one main
  ship + captains + modules + support craft → expedition → activity → return → inventory →
  progression → ranking); reclassification (**M2–M4 = Expedition Engine**, **M4.5 = Serial
  Build Queue Foundation**); standing laws (support craft = capacity-limited loadout, not
  additive power; one-directional pipeline *activity → pending → secure-on-return → inventory →
  progression → ranking*; don't replace the engine, replace the source of expedition stats via
  `calculate_expedition_stats`); the Phase 1–20 plan.
- **README** — intro reframed to main-ship expedition; milestones reclassified (Engine +
  Build Queue Foundation done) + forward direction → ROADMAP; removed the stale "M7 not
  started" / combat-reward-only framing.
- **ARCHITECTURE §16** — direction-update note + reclassification + pointer to ROADMAP.

**Not built (deferred to later phases):** main ship · captains · modules · inventory · trading
· exploration · mining · ranking. No migrations, no frontend behavior change. M2 11/11 · M3
13/13 · M4 40/40 · M4.5 27/27 unaffected. **Next:** Phase 2 (expedition activity architecture,
design only) when chosen.

---

## 2026-06-17 — ✅ M4.5 CLOSED (browser acceptance passed)

The automated **Playwright browser acceptance** test passed against the live Pages site —
M4.5's manual gate is met, so M4.5 is **closed**.

- **Browser test:** `tests/m45.spec.ts` (`verify:m45:browser`), CI workflow
  `.github/workflows/browser.yml`, run against `https://gkwngns714-spec.github.io/byeharu/`.
  **1 passed (17.3s).** Verified live: friendly coords (Sector 0:0, no raw "0, 0") · Train
  Scout ×5 active row (Per ship / Total order / Ship 1 of 5 / Remaining ticking / "delivered
  when full order completes") · Corvette ×2 waiting (no countdown, no Ship N) · cancel inline
  confirm (Refund + Penalty + Keep Building + Confirm Cancel) · Keep Building doesn't cancel ·
  Confirm refunds **once** (+125 = 50%) and the next waiting starts · refresh = no duplicate
  refund, cancelled gone · completed-history fold/unfold. Screenshots + traces uploaded as the
  `playwright-m45` CI artifact.
- **Backend:** `verify:m45` **27/27**; regression **M2 11/11 · M3 13/13 · M4 40/40**; CI build
  green. No gameplay/migration changes for the test (test infra only).

M4.5 reframed for the future as the **Serial Build Queue Foundation** (see
[[byeharu-final-direction]] — Main Ship + Support Craft). **Next:** Phase 1 docs/roadmap
reconciliation (docs only).

---

## 2026-06-17 — M4.5 Core UX + production queue law fix (CLOSED — see entry above)

**Status: NOT closed.** Fixes to the **M7 production queue** + two UI bugs (`build_orders`
is the M7 system — M5/M6/M7 already done; full M2–M7 kept green). Migration `0038`.

**Production now SERIAL** (was accidentally parallel — every order got `complete_at` on
creation): `build_orders` gains `waiting`/`active` states, nullable `complete_at`,
`started_at`; config `max_active_ship_production_slots=1` (designed to become N).
`train_units` enqueues **waiting** then `production_start_next` promotes one to **active**
(absolute `started_at` + `complete_at`). `process_build_queue` completes due **active**
orders then starts the next. Waiting items have **no `complete_at`** and don't tick.

**Cancellation:** `cancel_build_order` RPC — server-authoritative; validates ownership +
status; **waiting → 100% refund, active → 50%, completed/cancelled → rejected** (refund via
`Base.base_add_resources`). Cancelling the active item starts the next waiting one.

**UI:** `BuildQueuePanel` shows active (countdown) vs waiting (no countdown) + Cancel
buttons; `FleetStatusPanel` completed-history fold fixed (was an empty `<details>`) →
controlled toggle "Show N previous run(s)" / "Hide previous run(s)" with real content;
new `src/lib/location.ts` `formatLocationLabel` + `BasePanel` replace raw "0, 0" with
"Sector 0:0" / friendly names.

**Boundaries:** Production-only; combat/movement/world-state/reward untouched; absolute
timestamps (no per-tick decrement). `SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES` Production row already covers it.

**Verify:** `scripts/verify-m45.mjs` (serial · completion-starts-next · cancel waiting/active
· cannot-cancel-completed · ownership · anti-cheat · regression) — **supersedes `verify-m7`**
(parallel model; removed). CI `verify.yml` now runs `verify:m45`.

**Closure gate (pending):** deploy `0038` · `verify:m45` green · M2–M5 regression · CI build ·
browser check (serial countdown, cancel works, history folds, friendly coords).

---

## 2026-06-17 — M7 Ship Training (implemented; pending deploy/verify + click-through)

**Status: NOT closed.** Training-first ship production — the spending loop: **spend metal
→ queue training → cron completes ships into `base_units`**. Metal-only, timed queue, no
buildings/shipyard/research/captains/trade/mining/multi-resource.

**Migrations 0035–0037:**
- `0035_unit_costs.sql` — `unit_types.metal_cost` (scout 50 / corvette 150 / frigate 400);
  config `build_time_scale=1.0`, `min_build_seconds=5`, `max_build_orders=5`.
- `0036_production_system.sql` — `build_orders` table (Production-owned, RLS owner-read, no
  client writes); `base_spend_resources` (Base fn); `production_create_order/complete_order`;
  `train_units` RPC (auth → validate ownership/unit/qty/metal/queue-cap → `Base.spend` →
  `Production.create`); `process_build_queue` cron fn (FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED; idempotent —
  only `queued→completed`, ships never double-added); lockdown re-grant (+`train_units` to
  authenticated, `process_build_queue` to service_role).
- `0037_cron_build_queue.sql` — `process-build-queue` every 30s.

**Frontend:** `features/production/{productionTypes,productionApi,TrainShipsPanel,
BuildQueuePanel}`, `game/production/buildPreview` (cost+ETA preview, non-authoritative),
`catalog.ts` +`metal_cost`, `useGameState` +`build_orders`, `Dashboard` composes. Player
wording: **Train Ships / Training Queue / Not enough metal**. Only new action = `train_units`.

**Boundaries:** Production = sole writer of `build_orders` only; **never** writes
`base_units`/`base_resources` (spends via `Base.base_spend_resources`, deposits via
`Base.base_merge_units`). Acyclic Production→Base. Reward logic unchanged (only reads/debits
metal). No combat/world-state/movement changes.

**Verify:** `scripts/verify-m7.mjs` (16 tests) + `verify:m7`; CI `verify.yml` now runs
`verify:m7` (chains m5 → m2/m3/m4).

**Closure gate (pending):** deploy 0035–0037 · `verify:m7` green · M2–M6 regression · CI
build/typecheck · browser check (Train Ships + Training Queue render, train works, ships
appear).

---

## 2026-06-17 — M5 balance correction: pressure decay toward baseline (follow-up #3, Option A)

**Request** Fix the M5 issue where, with no players, every pirate_hunt location drifted to
pressure 100 / Severe and punished new players. **Option A only** (pure decay) — no newbie
zones, no new columns, no Option B/C.

**Change (migration `0034_worldstate_pressure_decay.sql`):** `worldstate_tick` passive
pressure now **DECAYS toward baseline** instead of drifting up:
`pressure += (baseline − pressure) * decay_rate − active_fleets * relief`. The step is a
fraction of the gap, so it asymptotes to baseline and **never overshoots** (decay_rate in
(0,1]). Empty locations return to **NORMAL** (baseline 50 → danger_modifier **exactly 1.0**
≈ M4); hunting still relieves below baseline; future defeat/event pressure can still raise
it above baseline (defeat_pressure remains a TODO, unwired). New config key
`worldstate_pressure_decay_rate = 0.1`. danger_modifier mapping unchanged.

**M5 law preserved:** World State still sole writer of `location_state`/`zone_state`; combat
**reads** `danger_modifier` only; presence is source of truth; `active_fleets` stays a
reconciled cache; cron unchanged (`process_location_state_ticks` → `worldstate_tick`). No
new schema/columns, no newbie zones, no frontend / combat / reward / fleet / presence
changes.

**Verify:** verify-m5 Test 2 changed from drift-up to decay (above→down, below→up,
at-baseline stays + modifier exactly 1.0, no overshoot, clamped); Test 4 relief made
deterministic. M2/M3/M4 regression unchanged.

## 2026-06-17 — ✅ M6 CLOSED (frontend depth / player clarity)

M6 browser re-test passed; milestone officially closed.

**Closure evidence:**
- M6 browser re-test passed.
- CI build/typecheck passed.
- Reports now show readable time.
- Round logs show per-round time.
- "en route" was removed from player-facing UI.
- Fleet wording is clearer: Traveling / Traveling to / Returning home.
- Dev-only ship grant script was added.
- No backend logic changed.
- No migrations changed.
- No combat math changed.
- No reward logic changed.
- M2–M5 backend systems remained untouched.

**Open follow-ups (tracked separately — NOT part of M6):** pre-existing react-hooks lint
cleanup · stuck throwaway test users/presences cleanup · danger pressure balance /
newbie-safe zones. **Next:** M7 (not started).

---

## 2026-06-17 — M6 Frontend Depth (implementation record — CLOSED above)

**Status: CLOSED 2026-06-17 (see closure entry above).** Implemented and CI-verified to compile; closure gate is a
manual browser click-through (below). Player-clarity pass over the M2–M5 loop —
**frontend only**: no migrations, no backend/combat/reward math, reads server truth only.

**Created (5):** `src/game/worldstate/danger.ts` (shared display labels +
High/Severe warning), `src/features/map/LocationPanel.tsx`,
`src/features/combat/RoundLog.tsx` (real `combat_ticks` fields only),
`src/features/combat/CombatReportPage.tsx` (`/reports`), `.github/workflows/build.yml`.

**Modified (9):** `combatApi.ts` (+read-only `fetchTicksForEncounter`, owner-RLS),
`useGameState.ts` (+`location_state` poll), `MapPage.tsx` (clickable cards → panel),
`SendFleetPanel.tsx` (pre-dispatch danger preview/warning), `FleetStatusPanel.tsx`
(lifecycle wording), `ActiveCombatPanel.tsx` (RoundLog replaces debug table),
`CombatReportsView.tsx` (link to `/reports`), `Dashboard.tsx` (pass states + nav),
`App.tsx` (`/reports` route).

**CI build/typecheck — ✅ green** (run 27656389298): `tsc -b` pass, `vite build` pass
(92 modules). `lint` is **non-blocking** and flagged 3 **pre-existing** M3/M4 files
(`useState(Date.now())`, `void refresh()` in effect — strict react-hooks v7); none of
the new M6 files. CI frontend verification is required since local npm is unreliable
(see [[byeharu-build-onedrive-bug]] equivalent note).

**Backend untouched:** zero migration/SQL/RPC changes; push did not trigger
deploy/verify. M5-close verification (M5 25/25 · M4 40/40 · M3 13/13 · M2 11/11) stands.

**M6 closure gate (manual browser click-through — all must pass):**
1. Map card click opens LocationPanel.
2. LocationPanel shows correct danger/activity + warning.
3. SendFleetPanel shows pre-dispatch danger preview.
4. FleetStatusPanel lifecycle wording is clear.
5. ActiveCombatPanel shows RoundLog (not the debug table).
6. Retreat/return messaging is understandable.
7. `/reports` opens correctly.
8. A past report can load its RoundLog.
9. No obvious broken layout.
10. No frontend writes to World State.

**Deferred (out of M6):** pre-existing react-hooks lint cleanup; danger-decay balance
(separate small migration only if the UI proves misleading — not rebalanced here).

---

## 2026-06-17 — ✅ M5 CLOSED (deployed + verified green in CI)

Migrations `0031`–`0033` deployed to the remote via the GitHub Action, and the new
**Verify** workflow ran the full suite on CI (Node 22). All green:

- **M5: 25/25** · **M4: 40/40** · **M3: 13/13** · **M2: 11/11** — 0 failures.
- M5 coverage proven: world-state rows seeded, passive drift, register/relief/
  unregister edges, active_fleets reconciliation, double-tick idempotency, and
  combat safely reading `danger_modifier` at a high-pressure location.
- M4 balance confirmed untouched (baseline pressure → danger_modifier 1.0).

**Bugs found + fixed during deploy/verify (couldn't surface without a live DB/CI):**
1. **pg_cron `'60 seconds'` invalid** (SQLSTATE 22023) — sub-minute syntax is 1–59s;
   60s must be standard cron `'* * * * *'`. Fixed in `0033`. (031/032 had already
   applied; 033 rolled back cleanly and re-applied after the fix.)
2. **CI on Node 20 threw "Node.js 20 detected without native WebSocket support"** —
   supabase-js 2.108's realtime client needs native WebSocket (Node 22+). Bumped
   `verify.yml` to Node 22.

**Verify CI:** secrets `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` / `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` /
`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` configured; workflow auto-runs after each deploy and on
manual dispatch. Verification no longer depends on the local toolchain.

**Next:** M6 (frontend depth) per `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §16.

---

## 2026-06-17 — M5 Living World (built; pending deploy + verify)

**Request** Build M5 per the "Living World Design Law": world-state pressure +
danger drift + location dynamics via a 60s cron, **without rewriting** the M2–M4
loop. Strict ownership (World State sole writer of `location_state`/`zone_state`),
combat may only *read* `danger_modifier`, acyclic cron, anti-cheat lockdown.

**Step 0 inspection (key findings)**
- No `worldstate_*` / `location_state` / `zone_state` existed — only deferred-stub
  comments (`0002`, `0008`). Built fresh.
- **Single unregister seam:** every terminal presence transition (escape, defeat,
  safe-leave) funnels through `presence_complete()` → one hook, not six.
- **Combat touches one function:** `combat_create_encounter` starts
  `enemy_integrity_current = 0`, so wave 1 spawns inside `process_combat_ticks`;
  the danger read goes there only.

**Work done (migrations `0031`–`0033`)**
- `0031_worldstate_tables.sql`: `location_state` (pressure/danger_modifier/
  active_fleets/last_tick_at) + `zone_state` rollup; public-read RLS, no client
  write; seeded one row per location/zone.
- `0032_worldstate_fns.sql`: 10 `game_config` keys (no magic numbers);
  `worldstate_register_presence` / `worldstate_unregister_presence` (cache ±1) /
  `worldstate_tick()` (reconcile active_fleets from real presences → drift/relief
  if elapsed ≥ min → bounded `danger_modifier` → zone rollup); service-role-only
  `dev_worldstate_prime` test helper; **edges wired** by re-creating
  `presence_create` (→ register) and `presence_complete` (→ unregister), behavior
  otherwise identical; **combat read** added to `process_combat_ticks` (× a
  fallback-guarded `danger_modifier`, else 1.0); re-locked execute surface.
- `0033_cron_location_state.sql`: `process_location_state_ticks()` → only
  `worldstate_tick()`; pg_cron every 60s. Cadences now 30s / 2s / 60s.

**Balance safety (Rule F):** `danger_modifier` is **piecewise with baseline → exactly
1.0**, and seed pressure = baseline = 50 → fresh locations multiply combat by 1.0,
so M4 numbers are unchanged until pressure actually drifts.

**Frontend (minimal, read-only):** `mapTypes.ts` `LocationState`; `mapApi.ts`
`fetchLocationStates()` (public read); `MapPage.tsx` shows "Pirate activity:
Calm/Rising/Severe" + "Danger: Low/Medium/High" on pirate_hunt cards. No writes.

**Verification:** `scripts/verify-m5.mjs` + `verify:m5` — Tests 1–9 (rows, drift,
register, relief, unregister, reconcile, danger-feeds-combat, double-tick
idempotency, M2/M3/M4 regression). Uses a **service-role key** to drive the locked
`worldstate_tick()`/dev helper (clients stay denied), mirroring the `dev_reset_player`
precedent.

**Not yet run (gated on user):** fresh clone has no `.env.local` and migrations
aren't on the remote. Local `npm install`/build also blocked by a known npm bug on
this OneDrive path (optional wasm deps `@tailwindcss/oxide-wasm32-wasi` etc. fail to
reify → "Exit handler never called", no `.bin` shims). **To finish M5:** `supabase
db push`, add `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to `.env.local`, `npm run verify:m5`.

**CI:** added `.github/workflows/verify.yml` — runs `verify:m5` (chains M2/M3/M4) on
ubuntu after the deploy workflow succeeds, or via manual dispatch. Sidesteps the local
npm/TLS toolchain blockers. Needs repo secrets `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`,
`VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.

**Also:** reconciled README milestone list to the real M1–M6 roadmap.

---

## 2026-06-17 — M4 cleanup (loose ends; verified 40/40)

**1. Reward deposit → home arrival.** Combat no longer deposits at escape. On
escape/auto-extract the pending rewards are attached to the return movement
(`fleet_movements.reward_grant_source` + `reward_payload_json` via new
`movement_attach_cargo()`), and `process_fleet_movements()`'s **return-arrival
branch** deposits them via `reward_grant` (idempotent unique source). Defeat → none
(zeroed). Deferred so future en-route risk/cargo "just works."
**2. Config extraction.** Added `reward_danger_scale=0.25`, `danger_time_divisor_seconds=180`,
`combat_damage_variance_pct=0.10`, `defense_curve_base=100`; `process_combat_ticks`
now reads them. No combat magic numbers remain in code.
**3. Dead code.** Dropped `fleet_apply_losses()` (superseded by combat_units +
fleet_sync_quantities; confirmed no live caller).

**UI:** combat pending note "secured only after your fleet returns to base"; returning
fleet shows "💰 rewards locked (secured on arrival)"; report "rewards secured when it
reaches base".

**Files:** `0030_m4_cleanup_reward_on_arrival.sql`; `scripts/verify-m4.mjs`;
`fleetTypes.ts`, `FleetStatusPanel.tsx`, `ActiveCombatPanel.tsx`, `CombatReportsView.tsx`;
`SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`. Backend: 1 migration. Frontend: wording/types only.

**Verify:** `verify:m4` **40/40** (escape: not deposited; return carries rewards;
arrival deposits exactly once +metal; defeat/retreat-death: none; destroyed don't
return), `verify:m2` 11/11, `verify:m3` 13/13.

**M4 closed — no known loose ends.**

---

## 2026-06-17 — M4 CLOSE (combined final pass; all verified)

**Part 1 — retreat + wording**
- Retreat delay **20s → 8s** (config `retreat_delay_seconds`; UI countdown reads it).
- Report wording "Return movement started." → "Fleet escaped — now returning to base."
  Banner → "fleet breaks away and heads home in Ns." Combat-state label friendly
  ("In combat" / "Next wave incoming" / "Retreating").

**Part 2 — edge cases (verify:m4 37/37):** destroyed-during-retreat → defeat (no
reward/return); retreat spam → exactly one accepted; **destroyed ships do NOT return**
(base = initial − lost, e.g. scout 98 after losing 2); one-encounter-per-fleet; reward
once (idempotent); safe-zone & invalid-location rejected; defeat leaves no stuck
presence. Browser-refresh/offline: all combat state is server-side (cron-driven), UI
reloads from backend — survives refresh/close. M2 11/11, M3 13/13 (no regressions).

**Part 3 — cleanup**
- Dev helper `dev_reset_player(uuid)` added — SECURITY DEFINER, **not granted to
  clients** (SQL-editor/service-role only): clears stuck combat/movement/presence.
- Reward-securing rule: granted at **escape** (combat end). Return trip is
  uninterruptible (no en-route combat), so this == "secured on guaranteed return";
  death only happens pre-escape → no reward. Kept as-is (would move to home-arrival
  only when en-route risk exists).
- Hard-coded values to extract in a future balance pass: reward danger factor 0.25,
  danger time-divisor 180s, ±10% variance, defense curve 100/(100+def).

**Files:** migrations `0027` (wave HP), `0028` (retreat 8s), `0029` (dev_reset);
`scripts/verify-m4.mjs`; `ActiveCombatPanel.tsx`, `CombatReportsView.tsx`.

**M4 is safe to close.** Remaining (low) risk: balance not tuned to fleet power;
weapon cooldowns prepared not implemented; a few hard-coded balance constants.

---

## 2026-06-17 — M4 final checklist audit (all pass)

**Request** 22-point M4 final checklist before moving on.

**Already passing (no change):** combat start rules, ownership/RLS, one-active-
encounter-per-fleet (partial unique indexes), fixed 3s tick, wave transition,
pirate scaling (HP+attack+reward all danger-scaled), player damage (single
aggregate, no double-count), per-group damage distribution, per-unit integrity,
damage carryover, ship destruction, retreat behavior, defeat behavior, reward
behavior (idempotent), combat feed, debug (`combat_ticks` incl. `unit_snapshot_json`),
processor idempotency (FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED), client/server authority, boundaries,
final summaries.

**Needed change:** wave pacing was ~2 ticks for a modest fleet at low danger
(undertuned vs the 3-6 target). Fix `0027`: `enemy_hp_base` 6→14 → easy waves ~3+
ticks, scaling to normal/strong with danger. Added verify cases C (damage w/o loss),
F (one encounter/fleet), G (safe zone starts no combat), pacing assert ≥3, defeat
leaves no active presence.

**Files:** `supabase/migrations/0027_wave_hp_pacing.sql`, `scripts/verify-m4.mjs`.
**Backend:** 1 config value (wave HP). **Frontend:** none.

**Verification:** `verify:m4` **33/33**, `verify:m2` 11/11, `verify:m3` 13/13 — no
regressions (checklist J). Wave 504→320 (dealt 185), 3+ ticks/wave; survivors report
`{scout:7,frigate:2,corvette:5}`.

**Remaining M4 risk (low):** wave HP scales with danger, not fleet power → a
massively-overpowered fleet still clears low-danger waves fast (acceptable/by design);
weapon cooldowns prepared but not implemented; per-unit before/after captured in
`combat_ticks` but not surfaced in the UI debug table. Deep balance deferred.

---

## 2026-06-17 — M4 combat clarity pass (verified 28/28)

**Request**
Combat now feels like a survival loop. Small clarity improvements + fixed-interval
tick confirmation.

**Backend (`0026`)**
- Combat tick **2/4s → fixed 3s** (cron + config; damage keeps ±10% variance, the
  *interval* is fixed/non-random per design). Confirmed fixed-interval model; per-group
  damage loop already structured for future weapon/unit cooldowns (not implemented yet).
- Added `combat_reports.survivors_json`; `report_create` now records exact survivors +
  losses from per-unit `combat_units` (drives the post-retreat summary).

**Frontend (clarity)**
1. Latest exchange while retreating: "Your fleet is retreating — weapons disengaged" +
   "Pirates dealt N damage during disengagement" (no more confusing "0 damage").
2. Pending rewards note: "Locked — secured only if your fleet returns home safely"
   (and not-secured warning while active).
3. Retreat banner: "Retreating — return movement starts in Ns" (ties to M3 spine).
4. Per-unit rows show "alive/original ships (N lost) · HP · %".
5. Post-retreat **result summary** in Combat reports: result, waves, ships returned,
   ships lost, rewards secured/forfeited, "Return movement started."
6. Top line: "Wave 3 · Danger 3 · 2 waves cleared · Retreating".

**Verification — `verify:m4`: 28/28** (incl. report survivors `{scout:7,frigate:2,corvette:5}`).
Boundaries intact: server-authoritative; client renders + retreat only; M3 movement
used only after retreat succeeds; no captain/trading logic.

---

## 2026-06-17 — M4 combat overhaul: pacing + per-unit HP (verified 27/27)

**Request**
Browser feedback: waves one-shot (HP 195 vs 385 dmg), no visible wave progress,
only total fleet HP, unclear feed. Make combat readable + per-unit correct.

**Root cause**
Wave HP and wave damage were the SAME number → a 385-attack fleet one-shot a
195-HP wave. Fixed by decoupling: wave **HP** scales large with danger; wave
**attack** is a separate, smaller danger-scaled value.

**Backend (migrations 0023–0025)**
- `0023`: tick 2s→**4s**; config knobs `enemy_hp_base`(6), `enemy_hp_danger_scale`(0.6),
  `enemy_attack_base`(1.0), `enemy_attack_danger_scale`(0.25), `wave_transition_seconds`(3).
  New table **`combat_units`** (per-unit-type combat HP: ship_hp, initial/alive count,
  hp_max/current, carries over between waves). `combat_create_encounter` snapshots it;
  `process_combat_ticks` rewritten: decoupled HP/attack, **server-side damage
  distribution across unit groups by ship count**, deterministic ship loss
  (alive = ceil(hp/ship_hp)), `next_wave_at` transition, richer event payloads,
  `fleet_sync_quantities` to write survivors back to Fleet. encounter `wave_number`;
  ticks `wave_number` + `unit_snapshot_json`.
- `0024`: re-lock execute (also block anon/authenticated default).
- `0025`: `fleet_sync_quantities` → **SECURITY INVOKER** (Supabase re-grants execute to
  authenticated on new fns and resists revoke; invoker means a client call runs as
  authenticated with no fleet_units UPDATE grant → denied; internal caller runs as
  owner → works). Grant-independent lockdown.

**Frontend**
- `combatTypes`/`combatApi`/`useCombat`: `CombatUnit` + fetch combat_units; encounter
  wave fields. `ActiveCombatPanel`: total + **per-unit-type integrity bars**
  (alive/initial ships, HP, %), wave-incoming display, "latest exchange", richer debug.
- `CombatEventLayer`: meaningful text ("Missile salvo hit the pirate wave for N
  damage", "Pirates damaged Corvette group for N hull", "N Scout destroyed",
  "Wave N cleared. +M metal pending", "Wave N incoming").

**Verification — `verify:m4`: 27/27**
- Lockdown: process_combat_ticks / fleet_sync_quantities / base_add_resources denied.
- A: multi-tick wave (HP 252→37, dealt 215; not one-shot), per-unit HP present +
  decreasing via distribution, metal accrued, retreat→escaped, reward once, +metal,
  return via M3.
- B defeat: 0 rewards, base unchanged, no return, destroyed. C retreat-death: same.

**Remaining:** wave pacing is multi-tick but on the short side (~2 ticks for a strong
fleet at low danger); deeper balance deferred per request — tunable via game_config
(`enemy_hp_base`, `enemy_hp_danger_scale`).

---

## 2026-06-16 — M4 fixes from browser feedback (verified 26/26)

**Request**
Browser testing surfaced issues. Fix before M4 complete.

**Fixes**
1. **Reward-on-defeat bug (critical, backend):** defeat kept accrued
   `total_rewards_json`, so the report/pending looked rewarded. Migration `0022`:
   on defeat (both paths) `total_rewards_json = '{}'`, no `reward_grant`, no
   `base_add_resources`, no return. reward_grant only ever called on escaped/completed.
2. **Integrity model (backend):** added `player_integrity_max/current`,
   `enemy_integrity_max/current` on encounters and `*_integrity_before/after` on
   ticks. Persistent integrity pool decreases each tick (visible HP), unit losses
   incremental-proportional → explains "hull damaged, no ships destroyed". Frontend:
   Fleet/Pirate-wave HP bars + "Latest exchange" (you dealt / they dealt / losses).
3. **Retreat reward-locking (backend):** while `retreating`, fleet takes damage but
   deals none, clears no waves, accrues no rewards (locked at retreat). `0022` adds
   `retreat_started_at`; frontend shows "Retreating — escaping in Ns" countdown.
4. **Completed history:** collapsed into "Completed history: N previous run(s)".
5. **Wording:** "use the Retreat button in the combat panel" (non-positional).
6. **Balance:** left as-is per request (combat still easy; tune later).

**Verification — `verify:m4`: 26/26 PASSED**
- Anti-cheat lockdown (4 fns denied).
- A escape: integrity exposed, pending accrued, retreat → escaped, rewards locked
  (no farming), reward_grants ×1, base metal +once, return created.
- B defeat (1 scout): defeat, destroyed, report 0 rewards, 0 reward_grants, base
  unchanged, no return.
- C retreat-death (6 scouts): defeat, 0 rewards, base unchanged, no return.
- (verify script bug fixed: `.catch` on supabase builder → plain await.)

Deploy: GitHub Action ✅ (migration 0022). Frontend build green (88 modules).

---

## 2026-06-16 — M4 frontend (active combat UI, display-only)

**Request**
Build the M4 frontend only (no backend changes): ActiveCombatPanel, CombatEventLayer,
combat reports view, ~1–2s combat polling, SendFleetPanel allows pirate_hunt. Client
display-only; combat_events cosmetic; combat_ticks truth/log; keep boundaries.

**Work done (files)**
- `src/features/combat/` — `combatTypes.ts`, `combatApi.ts` (read encounters/events/
  ticks/reports + `request_retreat`), `useCombat.ts` (1.5s poll), `CombatEventLayer.tsx`
  (cosmetic missile/laser/explosion feed), `ActiveCombatPanel.tsx` (danger/waves/
  survivors/pending rewards/Retreat + combat_ticks debug log), `CombatReportsView.tsx`.
- `SendFleetPanel.tsx` — dispatch to safe **and** pirate_hunt locations (danger label
  + combat warning).
- `FleetStatusPanel.tsx` — present hunt fleets show "in combat" (retreat via combat panel).
- `Dashboard.tsx` — renders ActiveCombatPanel per active encounter + CombatReportsView,
  using a separate faster `useCombat` poll. `index.css` — `bh-fade-in` for event feed.

**Boundaries:** client display-only; only action is `request_retreat`; no client math;
events cosmetic, ticks read-only. No backend changes.

**Verification:** `npm run build` green (88 modules, no type errors); dev server HTTP 200
at http://localhost:5173/. Visual click-through handed to user.

---

## 2026-06-16 — M4 backend: server-authoritative pirate combat (verified)

**Request**
Build M4 backend: active-feeling combat (2s server ticks), 20s retreat, single-resource
metal rewards, 30-min forced auto-extract safety cap. Server owns all outcomes; client
animates cosmetic events later. Strict boundaries; backend first.

**Security finding (fixed in this milestone)**
Probed the live DB: M1–M3 internal `SECURITY DEFINER` functions (e.g.
`base_reserve_units`, `fleet_set_present`, `process_fleet_movements`) were
**client-callable** — Postgres grants `EXECUTE` to `PUBLIC` by default and PostgREST
exposes the whole `public` schema. That's an anti-cheat hole (client could mutate
units/fleet state). Fixed in `0021_lock_function_execute`: revoke execute on all
public functions from public/anon/authenticated, `alter default privileges` to block
future leaks, and grant execute only on the 6 client RPCs (`get_world_map`,
`bootstrap_me`, `send_fleet_to_location`, `request_leave_location`, `request_retreat`,
`get_combat_reports`). Verified denied post-deploy.

**Work done (migrations 0012–0021)**
- Base `base_add_resources`; Fleet `fleet_combat_stats` + `fleet_apply_losses`.
- Combat tables `combat_encounters` / `combat_ticks` (truth log) / `combat_events`
  (cosmetic stream); Reward `reward_grants` + idempotent `reward_grant`; Report
  `combat_reports` + `report_create` + `get_combat_reports`.
- `combat_create_encounter`, `combat_set_retreating`, **`process_combat_ticks()`**
  (2s, FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED, idempotent; one tick row + several event rows; wave
  scaling, power combat, losses, rewards, defeat/escaped/completed).
- Presence `activity_start` routes hunt_pirates→Combat; `presence_request_leave`
  combat-retreat branch. Player RPCs: allow hunt sends (+min_power), `request_retreat`.
- Config: combat_tick_seconds 12→2, retreat_delay 30→20, max_presence_seconds 1800,
  reward_metal_base 10. Cron `process-combat-ticks` every 2s.

**Deploy:** GitHub Action run 27623526054 ✅ — 0012–0021 applied (incl. 2s cron + lockdown).

**Verification — `verify:m4`: 20/20 PASSED**
- Lockdown: 4 internal fns denied to client.
- Success: dispatch hunt → arrival → encounter active → ticks/waves/events accrue
  (danger rising) → retreat → escaped → fleet returning + return movement → reward
  granted exactly once (315 metal in base). `verify:m3` still 13/13 (lockdown safe).
- Defeat: 1 scout vs Pirate Den → wiped → defeat → fleet destroyed → defeat report →
  no return, no reward.

**Next:** M4 frontend (ActiveCombatPanel + cosmetic CombatEventLayer) — awaiting go.

---

## 2026-06-16 — ✅ M3 COMPLETE

Browser click-through passed; M3 accepted. Criteria met: units return correctly,
fleets complete correctly, no duplicate fleets, no console errors, no backend
errors. One UI wording bug found + fixed (`arriving in arriving…` →
`awaiting server confirmation…` once the client clock hits zero, while the cron
resolves; backend untouched).

**M4 requirement captured (user):** combat must feel MORE active than movement.
Movement stays slow (cron ~30s OK). Combat needs **faster server combat steps**
(tune `game_config.combat_tick_seconds`) and **client-side `combat_events` for
missile/laser visuals** — cosmetic, driven by server-authoritative results, never
client authority. Do NOT optimize movement's zero-countdown gap.

M4 not started — awaiting go-ahead.

---

## 2026-06-16 — M3 frontend (Command Center)

**Request**
Build the M3 frontend to click the live loop: base → send fleet → countdown →
present → leave → return → units restored. Keep modules separated; client only
requests + renders; M2 map read-only.

**Work done (files)**
- `src/game/movement/travelPreview.ts` — client ETA PREVIEW math only (mirrors
  server formula; not authoritative).
- `src/lib/catalog.ts` — shared `unit_types` read.
- `src/features/base/` — `baseTypes.ts`, `baseApi.ts` (ensureBase/fetch*),
  `BasePanel.tsx` (base + resources + units at base).
- `src/features/fleets/` — `fleetTypes.ts`, `fleetApi.ts` (send/leave + reads),
  `SendFleetPanel.tsx` (pick safe location + quantities, preview ETA),
  `FleetStatusPanel.tsx` (status/dest/countdown + leave button).
- `src/features/dashboard/useGameState.ts` — single 3s poll loop; panels stay
  presentational. `Dashboard.tsx` composes the panels (Command Center).

**Boundaries:** base UI in features/base, fleet UI in features/fleets, preview-only
math in game/movement; M2 map untouched/read-only; no client-side game authority
(all mutations via RPCs); reusable for future combat/trading/captains.

**Verification**
- `npm run build` green (tsc + vite, 83 modules, no type errors).
- Dev server serving HTTP 200 at http://localhost:5173/.
- Backend loop already proven by `verify:m3` (13/13) — frontend calls the same RPCs.
- Visual/console click-through: handed to user (browser).

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none in build)_

## 2026-06-16 — M3 backend built, deployed, and verified live

**Request**
Build M3 (movement + presence spine, no combat), deploy via GitHub Action, verify
the full backend loop. Keep systems separated; server authoritative.

**Work done**
- M3a migrations `0003`–`0005`: game_config, unit_catalog, base_system
  (bases/units/resources + initialize_new_player + signup bootstrap + backfill).
- M3b migrations `0006`–`0011`: fleet_system, movement_system, presence_system,
  movement_processor, player_rpcs, cron_movement (pg_cron 30s).
- Switched deploy to the free GitHub Action (3 secrets in GitHub UI). First run
  failed at *Link project* — invalid `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` secret; after user
  re-added a valid `sbp_` token, re-run succeeded.
- Wrote `scripts/verify-m3.mjs` (throwaway-user integration test) + `verify:m3`.

**Deploy result — GitHub Action run 27619768482: ✅ success**
- Migrations `0003`–`0011` all applied to remote, incl. `0011` (pg_cron enabled,
  job `process-fleet-movements` scheduled every 30s, no permission error).

**Verification — `verify:m3`: 13/13 PASSED**
bootstrap → base → starting units(100/20/5)+resources → dispatch to "Safe Rally
Point" → movement row (5.0s, dist 12.1) → units reserved 100→90 → processor resolves
arrival → fleet present + presence active(none) → leave → return movement
(return_home) → processor resolves → fleet completed → survivors merged 90→100.

**Bugs / fixes**
- Deploy 1 failed: bad `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` secret (JWT could not be decoded) →
  user re-added valid token → re-run green.
- verify:m3 v1: Supabase rejected `.test` email domain + a Node/libuv exit crash
  (auth auto-refresh timer). Fixed: use `@example.com`, `autoRefreshToken:false`,
  clean exit via `process.exitCode`.
- Email confirmation was ON → signup rate-limited; user disabled "Confirm email".

**Follow-ups**
- A few throwaway `m3test.*@example.com` users exist in auth (each with a base);
  harmless, can prune later.
- M3 frontend (base view, send-fleet panel, fleet status) is next.

## 2026-06-16 — M2 verified live against real Supabase

**Request**
Verify M2 against a real database before M3. Apply migrations (no manual SQL paste,
no secrets in chat).

**Setup**
- Supabase project created (ref `dlkbwztrdvnnjlvaydut`, Free plan, Asia-Pacific).
- GitHub repo `gkwngns714-spec/byeharu` (private) created; full project pushed.
- User chose Supabase's **native GitHub integration** + connected the repo.

**Work done**
- `.env.local` written with Project URL + **publishable** key (`sb_publishable_…`);
  git-ignored. Frontend uses publishable key only (never secret/service_role).
- Secrets handled via local git-ignored `supabase/.secrets.env` (access token +
  db password), loaded into transient env vars, **never** printed or committed;
  file deleted immediately after `db push`.
- Applied migrations via `npx supabase link` + `npx supabase db push`
  (`20260616000001_init_profiles`, `20260616000002_world_map`).

**Result — `npm run verify:m2`: 11/11 PASSED**
- Data: 2 sectors / 2 zones / 5 locations; nested sectors→zones→locations;
  3 pirate_hunt + 2 safe_zone.
- RLS read: anon can read sectors/zones/locations.
- RLS write-denial: insert blocked (42501 insufficient_privilege — SELECT-only grant),
  update/delete affect 0 rows.
- Frontend: dev server up at http://localhost:5173/ for click-through.

**Bugs / fixes**
- Native GitHub integration did **not** auto-deploy on Free plan (first verify found
  no tables). Applied via CLI instead. Future migrations need a deploy decision
  (upgrade for native, or use the free GitHub Action with secrets in GitHub UI).
- The redundant custom Action `deploy-migrations.yml` fails on push (no secrets set);
  left in place pending the deploy-mechanism decision.

**Follow-ups**
- Rotate/revoke the temporary Supabase access token (it lived only in the deleted
  local file, but rotate as good hygiene).
- Decide future migration deploy mechanism before/at M3.

## 2026-06-16 — System boundaries approved; M2 (read-only world map)

**Request**
Before coding, define strict system boundaries (sole writer per table, acyclic
cross-system call graph via exposed functions only). Approve and persist, then build
M2 as a **read-only** world map: `sectors`/`zones`/`locations` + seed +
`get_world_map()` + map screen. No movement/fleets/presence/combat/rewards/resources.

**Decisions made**
- Approved all 5 beyond-spec ownership additions: **Fleet**, **Base**, **World State**
  systems as sole owners of their shared tables; **`reward_grants`** ledger as the only
  reward-application path; **Activity** table-less router. _Why:_ enforces every
  separation law with a single-writer-per-table rule and prevents hidden coupling.
- M2 scope locked to the 3 static Map tables only; `zone_state`/`location_state`
  deferred (they belong to World State, built later) so Map stays pure.

**Work done**
- Wrote `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` (table→sole-writer matrix, per-system
  owns/exposes/forbidden, the 5 allowed call-edges, forbidden edges, invariant
  checklist).
- **M2 migration** `20260616000002_world_map.sql`: `sectors`/`zones`/`locations`
  (static, Map-owned) with CHECK constraints + FKs + unique(sector,name)/(zone,name);
  public-read RLS, no write policies (no client writes); `get_world_map()` (nested
  jsonb, `stable`, granted to anon/authenticated); seed = 2 sectors / 2 zones /
  5 locations (mix of `safe_zone` + `pirate_hunt`).
- **M2 frontend**: `features/map/` (`mapTypes.ts`, `mapApi.ts`, `MapPage.tsx`);
  `/map` route (auth-guarded); "Open galaxy map" link on Dashboard.
- Verified: `npm run build` green (tsc + vite, 75 modules). SQL not run locally
  (no psql/docker/supabase CLI on this machine) — reviewed by hand; first live run
  on migration apply.

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none)_

**Follow-ups for user**
- Apply migrations + set `.env.local`, then the map screen loads live data.
- M2 shows Map-owned fields only (name/type/danger/reward). Distance & travel-time
  need a base + movement formula → arrive in M3.

## 2026-06-16 — Foundation architecture & milestone plan (no code)

**Request**
User supplied a detailed server-authoritative PvE design spec (map → location →
movement → presence → activity → combat → retreat → return → report) and asked to
**plan only, no code yet**, then persist the design as living docs.

**Decisions made**
- **Economy = combat-reward only (Option 1).** Seed a starter base + starter units;
  resources come solely from pirate-combat rewards landing in `base_resources` at
  encounter end. _Why:_ the priority is proving the core world/loop foundation, not
  the economy. Adding production/buildings/training now would build too many systems
  at once and make bugs hard to isolate. Deferred: buildings, build queues, passive
  production, lazy resource accrual, unit training, research, trade/market, cargo.
- **Sequencing = movement+presence spine first (M3), combat second (M4).** _Why:_
  spec keeps movement and combat as separate systems bridged by presence; proving the
  movement→presence→return spine on a harmless `safe_zone` first isolates any later
  combat bugs to the combat system (which the `combat_rounds` table is built to debug).
- **Write architecture docs before any game code.** _Why:_ the spec is large and
  prescriptive; capturing it as `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` makes it the source of truth so
  every milestone (and future session) follows the same modular, anti-cheat,
  server-authoritative rules instead of re-deriving them.

**Gap resolutions agreed (added beyond original spec)**
- `base_resources` table — rewards need somewhere to land (not an economy system).
- `initialize_new_player()` — seeds starter base + units + resources (no training in MVP).
- `game_config` table — tunable balance (travel_scale, max_active_fleets, tick/retreat
  seconds, reward multipliers, random variance) without code redeploys.

**Work done**
- Verified Supabase Cron supports sub-minute (seconds) schedules on Postgres
  15.1.1.61+ → 30s movement / 10–15s combat / 60s location-state ticks are feasible.
- Wrote `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (core principle, world hierarchy, all systems, combat
  formulas, anti-cheat, RLS/RPC, state machines, constraints/locking/idempotency,
  cron timing, MVP table list, milestone roadmap M1–M6, deferred list).
- No game code or migrations written yet (next step: M2 world map, after review).

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none — planning only)_

## 2026-06-16 — Rename to Byeharu

**Request**
Change the game name to **Byeharu** (the initial scaffold used "Byeolharu"; user
confirmed the shorter spelling).

**Work done**
- Renamed project folder `byeolharu` → `byeharu`.
- Updated `package.json` / `package-lock.json` name, `index.html` title, README,
  the migration comment, the Supabase client warning tag, and the AuthPage /
  Dashboard headings from "Byeolharu" to "Byeharu".
- Updated saved project memory.

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none)_

## 2026-06-16 — Milestone 1: Scaffold + auth

**Request**
Rebuild the PvE space-strategy game from scratch as a clean web-first project named
**Byeolharu**. Stack: React + TypeScript + Vite, Tailwind, Zustand, Supabase
(Postgres + Auth + RLS + RPC + pg_cron). Server-authoritative, modular systems,
milestone-by-milestone. First milestone: scaffold + basic auth structure.

**Work done**
- Created Vite React+TS project at `C:\Users\디폴리스\byeharu`.
- Installed `zustand`, `@supabase/supabase-js`, `react-router-dom`, and
  `tailwindcss` + `@tailwindcss/vite` (Tailwind v4).
- Wired Tailwind via the Vite plugin (`vite.config.ts`) and `@import 'tailwindcss'`
  in `src/index.css`.
- Supabase client at `src/lib/supabase.ts`; env typing in `src/vite-env.d.ts`;
  `.env.example` with `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` / `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
- Auth: Zustand store `src/store/authStore.ts` (session, signIn/signUp/signOut,
  `init()` listener); `src/features/auth/AuthPage.tsx` (login/signup);
  `src/app/RequireAuth.tsx` route guard; routing in `src/app/App.tsx`.
- Placeholder `src/features/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx`.
- DB: migration `supabase/migrations/20260616000001_init_profiles.sql` —
  `profiles` table, RLS (own-row read/update), auto-create-profile trigger on
  `auth.users` (SECURITY DEFINER).
- CI: `.github/workflows/deploy-migrations.yml` to `supabase db push` on push to
  `main`.
- Removed default Vite demo files (`App.tsx`/`App.css`/sample assets); updated
  `index.html` title and `.gitignore` for env files.

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none yet)_

**Open follow-ups**
- User must create a Supabase project and fill `.env.local`.
- For CI: add repo secrets `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID`,
  `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD`.
- Run `npm run build` / typecheck once `.env.local` exists to confirm green.
