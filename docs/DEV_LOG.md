## 2026-07-03 — Trading V1 cleanup: extract shared docked-location helper (migration 0092; behavior-identical)

**Request.** The identical ~10-line "resolve docked location" block was copy-pasted verbatim into
`get_market_offers` (0087), `market_buy` (0089), and `market_sell` (0090). Extract ONE shared helper and repoint
the three RPCs, in a NEW forward-only migration — never editing 0087/0089/0090; behavior-identical; DARK.

**Work done**
- **New migration `20260618000092_trade_market_1_resolve_docked_location.sql`.** Adds
  `public.mainship_resolve_docked_location(uuid) returns uuid` (`security definer`, `set search_path`, `stable`,
  read-only): calls `mainship_space_validate_context`, requires `ok` + `state='at_location'`, then reads the
  present/location fleet's `current_location_id` — returns that id or NULL. Both original "not docked" null paths
  collapse to one NULL, which each caller maps to the same `{ok:false, reason:'not_docked'}` → behavior-identical.
- **Repointed all three RPCs** via `create or replace` (supersedes 0087/0089/0090 forward-only; those files are
  untouched). Each body is byte-for-byte its original except (a) the inline block → the helper call, and (b) the
  now-unused `v_ctx jsonb;` local dropped (dead after extraction). Flag gate, `mainship_resolve_owned_ship`
  ownership assert, per-ship lock, request-id idempotency, offer/volume/cargo checks, and all wallet/cargo/receipt
  writes are unchanged.
- **ACL — INTERNAL (deviation from the step's suggested `grant authenticated`, on security grounds).** The helper
  is revoked from public/anon/authenticated (no client grant), matching its true siblings
  `mainship_space_validate_context` / `mainship_resolve_owned_ship`. It does NOT assert ownership (the
  orchestrators do, before calling it); granting it to `authenticated` would create a new client-callable
  SECURITY DEFINER read that leaks any ship's dock. It is called only inside the SECURITY DEFINER trade RPCs
  (which run as owner), so the internal ACL changes no call path.
- **Law-doc sync (same step).** `SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`: named the helper in the Main Ship §2 row (shared
  read-only docked-location helper, internal, called DOWNWARD by Trade Market) and in the Trade Market row's
  docked-context read; extended the acyclic-fan-out note with the (pre-existing) Trade Market → Main-Ship-read
  edge, now a single named function.

**State.** Migration head now **0092**. No flag/behavior change; feature stays **DARK** (`trade_market_enabled`,
`TRADE_MARKET_ENABLED`, `mainship_additional_commission_enabled`, `MAINSHIP_ADDITIONAL_ENABLED` all OFF). No
migration ≤ 0091 edited; `main` untouched; not applied to production.

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none — pure de-duplication; three verbatim copies → one helper, behavior-identical.)_

---

## 2026-07-03 — Trading V1 cleanup pass: SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES doc-sync (docs-only; no behavior/flag change)

**Request.** Bring `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` back in sync with the actual schema after the TRADE-FLEET-0C /
TRADE-MARKET-1 migrations (0073–0091). Docs-only; touch no code, migration, RPC, workflow, or flag.

**Work done**
- **Corrected the stale one-ship-per-player claim.** §4 item 7 (and the §2 Main Ship row) asserted
  `main_ship_instances` had one row per player via a `player_id` UNIQUE. That UNIQUE
  (`main_ship_instances_player_id_key`) was **dropped in migration 0079** — a player MAY now own multiple ships.
  Both spots now state multi-ship is structurally allowed but stays **DARK**: sole-ship is a runtime shim / dark
  gate (`mainship_additional_commission_enabled=false`), not a schema constraint.
- **Documented the four new tables in the §1 ownership matrix** with their real sole-writers:
  `trade_goods` = **Reference/Config** (Trade Market static catalog; admin/migration, seed-only),
  `ship_cargo_lots` = **Trade Cargo**, `player_wallet` = **Wallet**, `trade_receipts` = **Trade Market**.
- **Added the three new systems to the §2 contract:** **Wallet** (downward leaf; `wallet_debit`/`wallet_credit`
  — both Main Ship (add-ship `main_ship_price` debit) and Trade Market (buy debit / sell credit) depend DOWNWARD
  on it, Wallet depends on nothing above → acyclic, no mutual dependency); **Trade Cargo**
  (`trade_cargo_add_lot`/`trade_cargo_consume` — per-ship volume-keyed lots; a leaf Trade Market depends on);
  **Trade Market** (`trade_receipts`; orchestrates buy/sell fanning out DOWNWARD to Wallet + Trade Cargo,
  reads `trade_goods` + docked context; DARK while `trade_market_enabled=false`). Added an acyclic-fan-out note
  confirming exactly one sole-writer per table and no second writer anywhere.

**State.** Docs-only. **No** migration/RPC/`MarketPanel`/workflow/flag change; migration head unchanged at **0091**.
The trade feature stays **DARK** (`trade_market_enabled`, `TRADE_MARKET_ENABLED`,
`mainship_additional_commission_enabled`, `MAINSHIP_ADDITIONAL_ENABLED` all OFF); `main` untouched.

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none — a law-doc that contradicted the schema was corrected; no behavior path changed.)_

---

## 2026-07-03 — TRADE-UI-1 landed DARK + PR-ready (ship-switcher + buy/sell + §2.5 sole-ship shim retirement)

**Request.** Complete **TRADE-UI-1** on `autopilot/20260703-064048`: the client trading surface (ship switcher,
market buy/sell) and the **§2.5 sole-ship shim retirement** (the UI passes an explicit `p_main_ship_id`). Additive,
gated **OFF**, behavior-preserving; no migration/DB/verifier/workflow/flag change; `main` untouched.

**Work done**
- **Client trade surface (DARK).** Selected-ship model `useMainShipSelection` (owner-reads `main_ship_instances`,
  auto-selects the sole ship, N-ship-ready); `ShipSwitcher` (selection-only; a single ship renders as a
  non-interactive sole entry); `MarketPanel` read view (wallet, occupied cargo m³ vs capacity, station offers)
  **plus per-offer buy/sell** wired to `market_buy` / `market_sell` — each intentional click is one idempotent
  command keyed by a fresh `crypto.randomUUID()`, a **synchronous in-flight ref** guards against double-submit, and
  a success re-reads wallet/cargo/offers via `refresh()`. Fail-closed server reasons map through the pure
  `tradeReasonMessage`. Everything mounts only behind `TRADE_MARKET_ENABLED = false` and is **double fail-closed**
  against the server `trade_market_enabled` flag (also false — the trade RPCs reject before any ship read).
- **§2.5 sole-ship shim retirement.** The client now sends an explicit `p_main_ship_id` at ⑤ port
  move-to-location, ④ space-stop, ③ movement-readiness, ② dock-services, ① repair, and ⑦ normalize-dock. Each is
  behavior-preserving: with one ship the sourced id equals the shim-derived sole ship; a transitional `null` still
  resolves via the server `count = 1` shim; ownership is server-asserted, so an explicit id can only ever act on the
  caller's own ship. ⑥ `command_main_ship_space_move` is **deferred by design** — its RPC intentionally never took
  `p_main_ship_id` in TRADE-FLEET-0C (it rejects at the coordinate gate before any ship read).
- Delivered as six small, independently-reviewable commits (map hooks/panels; plus `dashboard/MainShipPanel.tsx`
  for repair and `portentry/` for normalize under a deliberately-widened frontend scope, id-threading only).

**State.** Migration head **unchanged at `0091`** — TRADE-UI-1 touched **no** migration/DB/verifier/workflow. The
feature is **DARK and PR-ready** on `autopilot/20260703-064048`: buildable, **not deployed, not verified in
production**. All trade / add-ship gates + flags remain **OFF**: `TRADE_MARKET_ENABLED`,
`MAINSHIP_ADDITIONAL_ENABLED`, `trade_market_enabled`, `mainship_additional_commission_enabled`,
`mainship_coordinate_travel_enabled`.

**Human-gated follow-ups (NOT done, by design)**
- **Activate trading:** flip `trade_market_enabled` + `TRADE_MARKET_ENABLED` (and, for the multi-ship add-ship
  path, `mainship_additional_commission_enabled` + `MAINSHIP_ADDITIONAL_ENABLED`).
- **Server-side removal of the sole-ship shim** — a future migration, only once the UI-explicit-id path is merged.
- **Run the rendered `.uispec.ts` suites in CI** — this sandbox lacks the browser binary (`chrome-headless-shell`).
- **Small `react-hooks` lint-debt cleanup** — documented pre-existing suppressions in `usePortEntry.ts` and
  `useDockServices.ts` (a `useState`-initializer refactor; out of scope for the id-threading commits).

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none — additive dark UI + behavior-preserving id threading; no production code path changed.)_

## 2026-07-03 — Repo/docs sync + PORT-ENTRY player UI landing recorded (no new build)

**Request.** Pull `main` current on the local machine and bring the project docs (log, guide, PDFs) up to date.

**Work done**
- Synced local `main` (fast-forward **22 commits → `f48bc53`**). No code written this session.
- Recorded that the **PORT-ENTRY player UI** (PR #65, `cb0d4fe`) is **merged** — the player-facing **Claim First
  Ship** + **Finish Docking (normalize)** panel (`src/features/portentry/PortEntryPanel.tsx` + hooks) now exists,
  **frontend-only**, calling the migration-`0072` RPCs; no new migration.
- Refreshed the guide **Current project snapshot** with a 2026-07-03 note (`main` head → `f48bc53`, PORT-ENTRY UI
  merged, Trading V1 FIXED to volume-only, TRADE-FLEET-0A audit recorded via PR #66).

**State.** Migration head **unchanged at `0072`**; coordinate travel stays **DARK**
(`mainship_coordinate_travel_enabled = false`). Next planned: **TRADE-FLEET-0B** (user-approved multi-ship +
volume-cargo contract — design/approval only). Trading V1 not started.

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none — docs/sync only; no code path touched.)_

---

## 2026-07-02 — Trading V1 design record — FIXED product direction (volume-only per-ship cargo + multi-ship foundation) + TRADE-FLEET-0A read-only audit (DESIGN RECORD ONLY; nothing built)

**Request.** Do **not** begin Trading implementation. Fix the Trading V1 product direction (below) as binding for
design, and produce **TRADE-FLEET-0A** — a strict read-only impact audit for introducing **multiple persistent main
ships** and **ship-bound, volume-based cargo**. No branch, PR, migration, code, seed, workflow, deployment, or
production-state change; PORT-ENTRY, coordinate-travel, flags, and movement are untouched
(`mainship_coordinate_travel_enabled` stays **false**). Migration head remains **`0072`**.

> **Supersession note.** This direction **replaces** the earlier same-day draft that used **kilograms + cubic
> metres (dual mass+volume caps)** and allowed **same-port ship-to-ship transfer**. The FIXED model is
> **volume-only (m³)**, and **cargo transfer between ships is OUT of Trading V1 scope.** Mass / density / fuel /
> acceleration / handling are **future-only**, not part of this foundation.

**Fixed direction (binding for design):**

1. **Multi-ship from the start.** Multiple persistent main ships are a **Trading foundation**, not a later
   module/captain feature. A player may eventually own and operate several main ships **concurrently** (one docked
   & trading while another travels or docks elsewhere).
2. **Cargo is ship-bound.** Trade cargo is physically assigned to **one** ship; it moves only when that ship moves;
   it is **never pooled** across a player's ships. **No** account-level trade inventory. **No** remote buy/sell and
   **no** cargo teleportation.
3. **Volume-only capacity (m³).** Canonical storage + validation unit is **cubic metres**. Player-facing display may
   use m³ (and litres for small amounts). **No** abstract cargo units. **No** kilograms / mass / density / dual
   mass+volume in Trading V1 (those are explicitly future-only).
4. **Commodities have a defined physical volume.** Trade denominations (crate / pallet / tank / container / bundle…)
   each resolve to a **fixed canonical m³**; the capacity rule is **occupied volume only**.
5. **Every market action targets one selected ship** — owned by the player, physically **docked** at the relevant
   port, in an eligible state; buy/sell operate only on **that ship's** cargo.
6. **Coordinate travel stays dark.** Existing **port-to-port** travel is sufficient for the first economy; no
   coordinate-travel activation, change, or dependency is recommended.
7. **Out of V1 scope:** pooled fleet cargo; account-level trade inventory; remote market actions; **cargo transfer
   between ships**; port warehouses; automated trade routes; player-to-player trading; dynamic supply/demand;
   cargo loss / piracy / insurance / destruction economics; mass / density / fuel / acceleration / handling.

**Implementation sequence (design-level; unchanged ordering, cargo model corrected to volume-only):**

```
PORT-ENTRY (complete, mig 0072)
  → TRADE-FLEET-0A  read-only impact audit (this entry — design record only)
  → TRADE-FLEET-0B  explicit user-approved multi-ship + volume-cargo contract (design/approval only)
  → TRADE-FLEET-0C  coherent implementation slice (multi-ship + ship-bound volume-only m³ cargo, one slice)
  → TRADE-MARKET-1  server-authoritative market (offers, wallet, atomic volume-checked buy/sell vs a selected ship)
  → TRADE-UI-1      selected-ship market + fleet interface
```

**TRADE-FLEET-0A audit (read-only).** The full impact audit — every current one-main-ship assumption
(DB / backend / frontend / verifier / onboarding) classified mandatory / compatibility-sensitive / optional /
not-affected; cargo-locality guarantees; a minimal design-level data boundary; multi-ship concurrency & safety;
compatibility/migration risks across all ship states; affected frontend surfaces; verifier implications; blockers;
open decisions; and a recommended slice order — is recorded in
[`docs/TRADE_FLEET_0A_IMPACT_AUDIT.md`](TRADE_FLEET_0A_IMPACT_AUDIT.md). Key finding: the locking/idempotency
substrate is **already ship-scoped** (`mainship_space_lock_context(main_ship_id)`, no advisory/player lock;
idempotency keyed `(main_ship_id, request_id)`); the only hard single-ship blockers are the
`main_ship_instances.player_id UNIQUE` constraint and the uniform `where player_id = v_player` ship derivation.

**Work done**
- DEV_LOG (this entry) + ROADMAP Phase 10 row and Standing Law #1 annotated with the FIXED (volume-only) direction.
- New read-only audit doc `docs/TRADE_FLEET_0A_IMPACT_AUDIT.md` (replaces the superseded kg+m³ draft audit).

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none — design record only; no code path touched)_

## 2026-06-30 — OSN-COORD-ENABLE (dark) → PORT-ENTRY-1 first-ship commission/normalize → production verifier (head `0070` → `0072`)

Since the entry below (head `0070`, OSN port-to-port live, coordinate travel server-disabled) the project built the
coordinate-travel capability **end-to-end and left it DARK**, then shipped the **first-ship / port-entry** backend
(the Trading prerequisite), then added a dedicated production verifier for it. **Net production change:** migration
head **`0070` → `0072`**; **no flag flipped** — `mainship_coordinate_travel_enabled` stays **false**, coordinate UI
hidden, raw coordinate command server-rejected, port-to-port unchanged/enabled. `main` head `a947c8d`.

**Work done (in order):**

- **OSN-COORD-ENABLE-1B (migration `0071`, PR #57, deployed DARK).** Extended the authenticated read-model
  `get_osn_movement_readiness()` with one additive boolean `coordinate_travel_available = osn_available AND
  cfg_bool('mainship_coordinate_travel_enabled')` — derived from the existing anchored-origin decision, false for
  every caller while the gate is false. Disposable 2×2 truth-table proof; gated deploy.
- **OSN-COORD-ENABLE-1B-VERIFY (PR #58).** Repinned the read-only post-enable verifier to head `0071` + a
  single-RPC readiness-capability contract probe. Production read-only run: `OVERALL_PASS=true`.
- **OSN-COORD-ENABLE-1C (PR #59, Pages-deployed).** The frontend empty-space coordinate UI is now driven SOLELY by
  the server-derived `coordinate_travel_available` (strict fail-closed parser + `isCoordinateTargetingActionable`);
  the compile-time `OSN_COORDINATE_TRAVEL_ENABLED` constant is retired as the UI authority. **Effect:** when the
  server flag is later flipped true, the coordinate UI lights up with no redeploy; until then it stays dark.
  Live bundle independently verified dark.
- **PORT-ENTRY-1 (migration `0072`, PR #61, deployed).** First-ship commissioning + same-location dock
  normalization — the Trading prerequisite. `port_entry_commission_writer(uuid)` (service-role-only) inserts a new
  player's ship DIRECTLY into canonical `at_location` at Haven Reach; `commission_first_main_ship()` (authenticated,
  zero-arg) outcome matrix A–F; `normalize_main_ship_dock()` (authenticated) upgrades a coherent `legacy_present`
  ship in place. Two-phase lock protocol; proven with a real two-session concurrency race (B blocks on the
  `player_id` unique conflict until A commits). Additive function-only; no flag/data/coordinate change. **No
  player-facing UI yet.**
- **PORT-ENTRY-1-VERIFY-1 (PR #62, merged — tooling only).** A dedicated, dispatch-only, production-gated
  read-only verifier proving production contains exactly the three PORT-ENTRY functions (signatures, bodies via raw
  `pg_proc.prosrc` md5, `SECURITY DEFINER`, `search_path`, ACLs) AND the **complete** authenticated client-RPC
  inventory (exact 20-RPC set by OID). Disposable proof passes + fails closed for 8 mutation cases. **Not yet run
  against production** (the gated run is the next human-approved checkpoint).

**Current authoritative state (HELD):** head `0072`; `mainship_send_enabled=true`, `mainship_space_movement_enabled=true`
(port-to-port enabled), `mainship_coordinate_travel_enabled=false`, `coordinate_travel_available=false`. Coordinate
travel and Trading V1 are **not** started; PORT-ENTRY player UI is the next active development.

---

## 2026-06-29 — OSN enabled → Phase 9 docked-port surface → coordinate-gate hardening → Phase 10 Trading design (head `0068` → `0070`)

Since the PORT-LAUNCH entry below (head `0068`, ports public, OSN still dark) the project advanced through OSN
enablement, a first player-facing port surface, a coordinate-travel security fix, and a full Trading V1 design
pass. **Net production change:** migration head **`0068` → `0070`**; **OSN port-to-port travel is now ENABLED**;
**free arbitrary-coordinate travel is server-disabled by default.** Current live flags: `mainship_send_enabled =
true`, `mainship_space_movement_enabled = true` (port-to-port ON), `OSN_COORDINATE_TRAVEL_ENABLED = false`
(frontend) + `mainship_coordinate_travel_enabled = false` (server, new in `0070`). `main` head `6e2a091`.

**Work done (in order):**

- **OSN enablement (config-only; head stays `0068`).** The dark OSN port-to-port path was turned on via the
  controlled one-shot enable operation (`mainship_space_movement_enabled` false→true), independently read-only
  verified against production, and a disposable authenticated port-to-port journey (depart → arrive → dock
  `at_location`) confirmed live behavior. A ship docked at a port can now travel port-to-port; arbitrary
  coordinate travel stayed off.

- **Phase 9 — docked-port read surface (PR #49 → migration `0069`, deployed).** `get_my_current_dock_services()`
  (authenticated, read-only, zero-arg, `SECURITY DEFINER`): derives player → own ship → validated dock, and
  ONLY for the `at_location` state returns the port + its ACTIVE `location_services` (today: Docking). Frontend
  `DockServicesPanel` shows "Main ship docked at &lt;port&gt;" + service chips only when docked. No buy/sell/market.
  Proven (disposable RPC matrix + rendered UI), deployed `0068`→`0069`, read-only verified live (`OVERALL_PASS=true`).

- **Phase 9 closeout (PR #50, frontend/tooling only — no migration).** Dock-context hardening (stale-data
  protection on a lifecycle change, safe-failure, mobile width cap), the one stale player-facing string fixed,
  and the current-state verifier `osn-postenable-verify` repinned head `0068`→`0069` + dock-surface ACL
  assertions; the historical pre-enable verifiers were left untouched.

- **OSN-COORD-GATE-1 (PR #51 → migration `0070`, deployed).** Closed a real gap: the public raw coordinate
  command `command_main_ship_space_move` was guarded only by `mainship_space_movement_enabled` (true for the
  enabled port-to-port path), while the "free coordinate travel OFF" control was **frontend-only** — so a direct
  authenticated API caller could request arbitrary coordinates. Fix: a server-owned key
  `mainship_coordinate_travel_enabled` (default **false**); the raw command now returns `coordinate_travel_disabled`
  BEFORE any ship read / lock / writer call (no side effect) while the key is false. The location-target command
  `command_main_ship_space_move_to_location` is **unchanged** (still governed by `mainship_space_movement_enabled`;
  port-to-port unaffected). Disposable matrix `ok[1..7]` green; deployed `0069`→`0070`. Gate ships **false**.

- **Phase 10 Trading V1 — design & calibration (DESIGN ONLY; nothing built).** A full pass produced the Trading
  V1 contract: free-port model (trade eligibility = own ship's validated current dock + active `market`
  capability), a **HYBRID cargo** model (account loot stays in `player_inventory`; a per-ship trade-hold carries
  trade goods), a **lazy player wallet** (currency separate from items), server-owned **`market_offers`**
  (price/availability, never in `location_services`), **`trade_receipts`** whole-trade idempotency, a per-offer
  **purchase-allowance** throttle, 7 proposed original commodities + a capacity-accurate 3-port matrix, and a
  route/balance simulation (no same-port profit; no unbounded reinvestment). Two hard findings: (1) a brand-new
  player has **no main ship** today (`bootstrap_me` makes only a base; `ensure_main_ship_for_player` is
  service-role-only with no player path) — so **main-ship provisioning** is the gating prerequisite; (2) trading
  needs the OSN `at_location` state, which neither `repair_main_ship` (→`home`) nor the legacy
  `send_main_ship_expedition` (→`legacy_present`) produces, while `command_main_ship_space_move_to_location`
  refuses a `home` origin by design — so a canonical **port-entry transition** is needed. Cargo-loss-on-destruction
  is deferred (free instant repair makes any recovery grant farmable). **No migration / seed / RPC / wallet /
  market / UI was created.**

**Bugs / fixes**
- Phase-9 dock proof: the in_transit fixture inserted the movement before its fleet (FK order) — fixed.
- Coord-gate proof: the disposable chain defaults `mainship_space_movement_enabled=false` (production's `true`
  is runtime, not a migration), so the first gate fired before the new gate — the proof now enables the
  movement domain on the disposable stack.

**FORWARD PLAN (approved direction; not started):**
1. **Main-ship provisioning — the prerequisite that gates all of Trading.** A one-time authenticated "Commission
   Your First Ship" claim that atomically creates ship + fleet + presence + an `at_location` dock at one
   designated **starting port** (a spawn placement, **not** a home port; `player_home_port` stays unused), plus
   a canonical OSN **port-entry transition** so existing `home`/`legacy_present` ships can reach a tradeable
   `at_location` state.
2. **Trading V1 implementation** (only after the open decisions below are approved): read model
   (`trade_goods` / `market_offers` / `player_wallet` / `ship_trade_cargo` / `trade_receipts` / allowance) →
   market capability + catalog seed → atomic idempotent buy/sell write path → Market UI from the Phase-9 dock
   seam → disposable proofs → gated deploy → read-only verifier.
3. **Then** Exploration (Phase 11) → Mining (Phase 12) → Modules/Captains (13–16) → Ranking (17) → economy/polish (18–20).
4. **Cross-cutting, deferred:** the `world_sites` canonical identity layer (build only when its F2 trigger
   fires), Online Presence & Visibility, main-ship combat, and a cargo-loss / repair-cost redesign.

**Open product decisions (need user approval before any Trading build):** cargo model (hybrid), currency (lazy
wallet, start 0), first commodities + price matrix, per-offer allowance + reset window, starting spawn port,
first-voyage starter cargo, and credit purpose (proof loop accumulating toward a future ship/captain/module sink).

## 2026-06-27 — PORT-LAUNCH: public port launch (foundation → reveal → independent verification)

The OSN-HUB-1A line (head `0067`, prior entry) advanced through the full **PORT-LAUNCH** epic: the dark
public-launch back end + front end were built and production-verified, then the three starter ports were
**revealed** in a single controlled, human-gated operation, and the result was **independently, read-only
verified** against production. Net production change: migration head **`0067` → `0068`**; authenticated
client-RPC surface **16 → 17**; the three starter ports **hidden → active/public**. **OSN port-to-port
movement stays dark** — `mainship_send_enabled = true`, `mainship_space_movement_enabled = false`,
`OSN_COORDINATE_TRAVEL_ENABLED = false` (frontend) — all unchanged by this epic.

**Requests / work done (in order):**
- **ENABLEMENT-1 (PR #36 → `3b5e6ce`).** Re-pinned `scripts/osn-enablement-preflight.sql` to head `0067` /
  surface `16`, widened space|location target checks, mirrored the function inventory into the DOCK-0 / HUB-1A
  allowlists. Tooling/gate only — no gameplay, no flag flip.
- **Fixture maintenance (PR #37 → `83d44e6`).** Replaced a global "anchors empty" assumption with an exact
  identity baseline (the three 0066 starter-port anchors). Housekeeping; depended on #36 landing first.
- **Enablement preflight (run `28253259301`).** Read-only production check → `OVERALL_PASS=true` at 0067/16.
- **PORT-LAUNCH-1A (PR #38 → `122374f`, migration `20260618000068`).** Added `reveal_starter_ports()`
  (service-role-only, one-way, all-or-nothing, never auto-invoked; locks the full sector→zone→location→anchor
  →service hierarchy before validating) and `get_osn_movement_readiness()` (authenticated, read-only; reports
  `osn_available=false` while the flag is off). Surface 16→17.
- **Deploy 0068 (run `28281667811`).** Human-gated deploy; head `0067`→`0068`; functions + surface re-lock
  only, **zero data change** (no reveal, no flag, no row touched).
- **Catalog-verifier refresh (PR #39 → `27df8e8`) + production verify (run `28288983383`, `OVERALL_PASS=true`).**
  Re-aimed the read-only catalog verifier at 0068/17; proved production still dark (ports hidden, flags off).
- **PORT-LAUNCH-1B (PR #40 → `ab07f14`).** Dark port-to-port travel UI (PortNavPanel / osnReadiness /
  portMoveCommand / osnReleaseGates); shows nothing while the flag is off; in-transit keeps route/ETA/Stop.
- **PORT-LAUNCH-2A (assessment) + 2B (PR #41 → `589abb9`).** Read-only onboarding-readiness recon, then a
  disposable full-chain proof: reveal → real `send_main_ship_expedition` accepts Haven Reach → real arrival
  settles → resolver returns anchored → readiness `anchored` (flag off) → world reverted. Added the verifier's
  A9 `STP_*` fail-closed pre-reveal checks.
- **PORT-LAUNCH-2C (PR #42 → `33af7e8`).** The controlled one-shot reveal workflow: `workflow_dispatch` only,
  `main`-only, typed `REVEAL_THREE_STARTER_PORTS` confirmation before any DB connection, `production`
  environment gate, pinned-CA verify-full, one transaction (lock → preconditions → reveal ×1 → postconditions
  incl. an **identity-level non-canonical digest** → commit-only-on-pass), rerun/uncertain fail-closed, no
  retry. Disposable proof `ok[1..6]`.
- **PORT-LAUNCH-2D (run `28294311791`).** Dispatched + approved; reveal executed once:
  `REVEAL_FUNCTION_CALLS=1 · STARTER_PORTS_ACTIVE_AFTER=3 · FLAGS_UNCHANGED=true · REVEAL_OPERATION_PASS=true`.
  Three ports hidden → active. One-way.
- **PORT-LAUNCH-2E (PR #43 → `00dfdd2`, run `28295627367`).** New independent read-only post-reveal verifier
  (`scripts/postreveal-verify.{sql,sh}` + `.github/workflows/postreveal-verify*.yml`) — leaves the dark-state
  verifier untouched; checks the server catalog **and** the authenticated `get_world_map()` boundary. Live run
  returned `MIGRATION_HEAD=0068 · CANONICAL_PORTS_ACTIVE=3 · CANONICAL_PORTS_HIDDEN=0 ·
  UNEXPECTED_PORT_STATE_CHANGES=0 · AUTHENTICATED_MAP_PORTS_VISIBLE=3 · MAINSHIP_SEND_ENABLED=true ·
  MAINSHIP_SPACE_MOVEMENT_ENABLED=false · OVERALL_PASS=true`.

**Bugs / fixes:**
- **1A lock-order TOCTOU** — reveal first locked only the three port rows; hardened to lock the full hierarchy
  (sector→zone→location→anchor→service) in a fixed order before validating; proven with concurrent psql sessions.
- **1A duplicate-insert proof premise** — the real block is a synchronous unique-constraint violation, not an
  FK lock-wait; proof corrected to assert the actual mechanism.
- **2B forced arrival** — back-dating only `arrive_at` violated `fleet_movements (arrive_at > depart_at)`;
  fixed by moving the whole travel window into the past.
- **2C postcondition** — net "+3 active" could be fooled by an offsetting change; added an `md5` digest of every
  non-canonical `(id,status)` to prove identity-level invariance.
- **2E test-harness** — a `emit_markers | grep -qx` happy-path assertion was fragile under `pipefail`; switched
  to reconcile + direct `mval` spot-checks (verifier logic itself was correct on first run).

**State after this epic (all on `main`, head `00dfdd2`):** production head **`0068`**, surface **17**, three
starter ports **active/public** (independently verified), flags unchanged (send `true`, space `false`). The
in-game OSN travel panel is built but dark. The only remaining arc item is the separate, optional, future OSN
flag-enable decision (`mainship_space_movement_enabled = true`) — **not started, not needed, not urgent.**

## 2026-06-26 — Session wrap-up + FORWARD PLAN (notes/design only; nothing started)

Closing-session record. **No product code / migration / workflow / verifier / flag / production change** in
this entry. Captures where things stand after OSN-HUB-1A and the deliberately-gated next steps, so the next
session can resume without re-deriving.

**State at this wrap (all on `main`):** product/production migration head **`0067`**; `main` is the
OSN-HUB-1A closure + verifier-tooling line (PRs #31 product, #32/#33 read-only verifier tooling, #34 closure
record). **OSN is DARK** and stays dark: `mainship_send_enabled = true` (legacy named-location travel LIVE),
`mainship_space_movement_enabled = false`. Hidden starter ports remain hidden/ineligible/unassigned; no
home-port assigned; no base anchor; no public OSN enablement. OSN-HUB-1A was merged → deployed (`0067`) →
read-only verified (production catalog verifier run `28229418325` = `OVERALL_PASS=true`) → formally closed
(prior entry). The legacy `bases.x/y` / `locations.x/y` coordinate path is frozen; the OSN coordinate domain
resolves origins/targets through canonical `space_anchors`.

**Reusable asset created this line of work:** a dispatch-only, production-`environment`-gated, **strictly
read-only** production catalog/ACL/configuration verifier (`scripts/osn-hub1a-production-catalog-verify.{sql,sh}`
+ `.github/workflows/osn-hub1a-production-catalog-verify.yml`, disposable proof `…-proof.yml`). It answers
"does production still match the approved dark state at head 0067?" via one `REPEATABLE READ READ ONLY`
snapshot + rollback (pinned CA / `verify-full` / session-pooler). Model future "is prod still in the approved
known state?" checks on it. **Lesson encoded in it:** Supabase hosted **default privileges** grant
`EXECUTE`-to-`service_role` on `public` functions that a migration doesn't explicitly revoke for `service_role`
— so a public RPC granted only `to authenticated` still has `service_role` EXECUTE on prod but not on the
disposable local stack; assert such platform-default ACLs as an **explicit production policy**, not
reference-vs-local parity (this was PR #33 "correction A").

**FORWARD PLAN — NOT STARTED. Each item needs its own separately-approved owner charter; do not begin on your
own. No flag flip / port reveal / home-port assignment / anchor seed as a side effect.** Ordered by readiness:

1. **ENABLEMENT-1 (tooling/gate maintenance — no gameplay, no flag flip).** Re-pin
   `scripts/osn-enablement-preflight.sql` from migration head `0064`→`0067` and the authenticated client-RPC
   surface `15`→`16` (it currently fails-closed on the new head/surface — *that is why it was deferred*).
   Update the **DOCK-0 perm allowlist** (`scripts/osn3-dock0-realchain-perm.sql`, exact-15 client-RPC list) to
   add `command_main_ship_space_move_to_location` (the same maintenance OSN-4 did for its Stop wrapper).
   Preserve the read-only / fail-closed / `verify-full` / pinned-CA contract. This unblocks a *green*
   enablement preflight; it does NOT enable anything.
2. **OSN flag-enable go/no-go (the first player-facing OSN change).** Only after ENABLEMENT-1 + a green
   production enablement preflight + an explicit owner decision: flip `mainship_space_movement_enabled=true`
   via the controlled `dev-mainship-space-movement-flag.yml` workflow. Reversible (single config key).
3. **Port-centric world build-out (heavy, charter-gated).** Reveal/seed real ports; seed canonical
   `space_anchors` for reachable locations; assign home-ports (`assign_home_port`); per the **F2 Option C**
   packet add the canonical `world_sites` identity layer (G1+) with the strict 1:1 immutable `locations`
   bridge; geographic-zones layer; possibly the **World Workbench** authoring plane first
   (`PORTCENTRIC_DECISION_PACKET.md` / `F2_COMPATIBILITY_MODEL_DECISION_PACKET.md` are the approved sources).
4. **Baseline activities & beyond (depend on OSN live + ports).** Exploration / Mining / Trading → Online
   Presence v1 → player interaction; Repair & Recovery (replace the instant-Home safelock); main-ship combat;
   captains / modules / rankings. Long-order rationale: `docs/BYEHARU_PROJECT_GUIDE.md` §10–11 and
   `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

**Ship discipline that produced this line (keep using it):** one owner-authorized step per message
(build → disposable CI proof → PR → pre-merge integrity review → admin-override no-ff merge → deploy →
read-only verify); the human owner approves every `environment: production` gate; never flip a flag / reveal a
port / dispatch or approve a workflow as a side effect; work in a throwaway worktree off `origin/main` and
never touch the stale `osn3-dock0-location-arrival` checkout.

---

## 2026-06-26 — OSN-HUB-1A FORMALLY CLOSED — dark canonical location-target navigation, deployed + verified (flag OFF)

Administrative closure record (notes only; **no product code / migration / workflow / verifier / flag /
production change** in this entry). **OSN-HUB-1A is formally closed.**

- **What shipped (PR #31, merge `09f8ba6`, migration `0067`).** The dark, additive **canonical location-target
  navigation** foundation: the OSN coordinate domain now resolves a docked **origin** and a named-location
  **target** through canonical `space_anchors` (NOT legacy `locations.x/y` / `bases.x/y`). One discriminated
  core writer `mainship_space_begin_move_core` (the deployed 5-arg `mainship_space_begin_move` preserved as a
  space-only delegate); the single canonical target-legality rule `mainship_space_location_target_legal`
  (active sector/zone/location + role city|port + `activity_type='none'` + one active docking service + one
  active in-bounds anchor); anchored origin resolution (HOME stays fail-closed `origin_not_anchored`, no base
  anchor); Dock-0 (`mainship_space_dock_at_location`) re-pointed from `locations.x/y` to the canonical anchor
  with **full arrival-time revalidation** under target-hierarchy `FOR SHARE` locks and a `clock_timestamp()`
  settlement time (`resolved_at >= arrive_at`); OSN-4 **Stop compatibility** for location routes (mid-flight
  interpolated stop / at-or-after-arrival settles via the SAME Dock-0 decision; `mainship_space_settle_space_arrival`
  stays strict space-only); and the one new public authenticated wrapper
  `command_main_ship_space_move_to_location(uuid, uuid)` (flag-gated before target resolution; hidden-port
  UUID ≡ nonexistent → generic `invalid_target`; **authenticated surface stays exactly 16**). Frontend is
  read-only/dark (`target_location_id` read-model; location routes render only to VISIBLE destinations).

- **Deployed.** Production migration head **`0067`** (`Deploy Supabase migrations` run `28219980298`, approved
  production gate). OSN remains **DARK**: `mainship_send_enabled = true`, `mainship_space_movement_enabled =
  false`. **No port reveal, no home-port assignment, no base anchor, no flag flip, no player/world mutation.**

- **Verified (read-only).** Final corrected production catalog/ACL/configuration verifier run **`28229418325`**
  → **`OVERALL_PASS=true`** at verified main **`30e5a36`** (verifier tooling commits; product head `0067`
  unchanged). One `REPEATABLE READ READ ONLY` snapshot + `ROLLBACK`; **no production write**. All assertions
  passed: dark-state (head 0067, flags dark, zero active coordinate movement, no incoherent pointer, empty
  `player_home_port`, no base anchor); hidden-world (3 hidden ports hidden/ineligible/absent from
  `get_world_map`, one anchor + one docking service each, original five intact); RPC surface **exactly 16** +
  anon limited to `get_world_map`; the **13 internals service_role-only** + catalog tables locked down; **6/7
  function bodies + descriptors byte-identical** ref↔prod; and the public wrapper's explicit hosted-production
  **`service_role EXECUTE = true`** policy.

- **Verifier tooling PRs.** **PR #32** (merge `09f8ba6`→… on `main`) added the dispatch-only, production-gated,
  strictly read-only verifier. **PR #33** (merge `30e5a36`) was a **verifier-only correction**: the public
  wrapper is granted only `TO authenticated` in `0067`, so its `service_role EXECUTE` is governed by Supabase
  hosted DEFAULT PRIVILEGES (allowed) which the disposable reference does not reproduce; PR #33 replaced that
  accidental local-reference dependence with an **explicit, testable hosted-production `service_role EXECUTE =
  true` contract** (strict parity preserved for the body hash + args + lang + owner + SECDEF + search_path +
  anon/authenticated/PUBLIC, and full SRVX parity for the six internals). Both PRs were **verifier tooling
  only** — no migration, no production data/ACL change.

**NEXT:** the next product step (e.g. ENABLEMENT-1 / the OSN enablement preflight re-pin to head `0067` +
surface 16, the DOCK-0 perm allowlist update, then any controlled OSN flag-enable go/no-go) requires a
**separately approved charter**. None is started. OSN remains dark.

## 2026-06-23 — ANCHOR-2 P0-A census closed + PORT-CENTRIC direction (durable handoff; design/ops only)

Cross-computer handoff record. **No code/schema/migration/anchor/resolver/flag/production change** — this entry
makes the current direction recoverable from `main`.

**1. ANCHOR-2 P0-A census — CLOSED.** One authorized, production-Environment-gated, **read-only** count-only
census ran and succeeded — workflow `osn3-anchor2-p0a-homebase-census.yml`, **run `28061856879`**, source commit
**`a12743f4829782530fc05015af509135886f8bf3`**, one `BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ READ ONLY`
snapshot then **`ROLLBACK`** (no write). Result: `TOTAL_SHIPS=72`, `ELIGIBLE=72`, `UNRESOLVED=0`; the
one-ship-per-owner invariant held (`72 = DISTINCT_NON_NULL_SHIP_OWNER_IDS`); zero null-owner/orphan/no-base/
inactive-only/multi-base anomalies. This closes **only** the old-data ambiguity prerequisite (legacy base records
are clean). **The census must not be rerun without explicit authorization.**

**2. PORT-CENTRIC direction (supersedes the home-base P0 plan).** Byeharu is a **multi-port navigation world**,
not a permanent-main-base game. A ship's meaningful normal location is its **current docked port**. Normal loop:
`Dock at Port A → depart → travel/act → dock at Port B → depart from Port B`. The permanent
`main_ship_instances.home_base_id` / ship-to-owner-base P0 plan is **CANCELLED** (no FK / NOT NULL / backfill /
creation-path change). Legacy `bases` are **bootstrap / starter / registration / possible-recovery records only**,
never operational homes. "Return home" is **not** ordinary navigation; emergency recovery is separate future work.

**3. Technical boundary.** The existing dark `at_location` state (ship `spatial_state='at_location'` + the fleet's
`current_location_id` + an active `location_presence`) is the **proto current-dock model**. `space_anchors`
(migration 0063, empty/dark) remains the **future fixed-coordinate foundation**. Future port docking/departure must
resolve through **location identity + the eligible port's canonical `space_anchors` (kind='location') coordinate** —
not legacy `locations.x/y`. The current dark DOCK-0 exact-match against `locations.x/y` (migration 0061) is proto
behavior only and **remains unchanged**.

**4. Map-growth policy.** The open-space boundary stays **≈ `[-10000, 10000]²`** — a **temporary technical
frontier**, not a permanent world/lore edge; no final map size is chosen. Future expansion grows **outward** and
**preserves all existing coordinates** (do not remap/move existing ports, anchors, ships, or players); keep the
initial central region **dense** and reserve outer space for later. **No map-size expansion is authorized now.**

**5. Exact next project gate.** *Next work is a **port-centric product-decision packet**: port eligibility, dock
identity, legacy-base/recovery role, recovery model, anchor-seeding scope, and initial central-region layout
policy. No ANCHOR-2 implementation, anchor seeding, resolver change, map work, coordinate command work, migration,
or flag change is authorized before those decisions.*

Live baseline unchanged at this handoff: production migrations end at **0063**; `mainship_send_enabled=true`,
`mainship_space_movement_enabled=false`; OSN paused.

## 2026-06-23 — MSP-0: Main Ship Progression ↔ Movement integration contract (design only)

Read-only reconnaissance + integration contract answering where future main-ship progression stats must live
so the current named-location route and future OSN movement consume **one** server-calculated result. **No
code/migration/workflow/flag/branch change — design packet only.**

- **Speed-truth trace.** Both routes derive main-ship speed solely from `main_ship_hull_types.base_speed`
  (`starter_frigate=1.0`): legacy `send_main_ship_expedition`/`move_main_ship_to_location`/
  `request_main_ship_return` → `resolve_fleet_movement_speed` → `movement_create` (LIVE); OSN
  `mainship_space_begin_move` reads the hull inline + computes duration inline, with `resolve_fleet_movement_speed`
  only as an equality assert (DARK). Speed + `arrive_at` are snapshotted once at departure, never recomputed at
  arrival. Frontend submits **intent only** (no client speed/duration math; the one `previewTravelSeconds` is
  dead code).
- **Divergence to prevent (already nascent):** `calculate_expedition_stats` computes a support-craft speed
  penalty that live movement ignores.
- **Recommendation (Option B):** one private main-ship-keyed `mainship_effective_stats` resolver
  (`effective_travel_speed` first; empty loadout ≡ raw hull base ⇒ current behavior byte-for-byte unchanged)
  that both movement adapters consume. First slice = **module-first**, first effect = travel speed on the live
  named-location route. Phases MSP-0..MSP-4 defined; module/captain schema is greenfield (only integer
  `module_slots`/`captain_slots` counts exist today).

**No implementation started.** Flags unchanged (`mainship_send_enabled=true`, `mainship_space_movement_enabled=false`);
migrations end at **0063**. NEXT (needs approval): Option-B decision + **MSP-1** (additive, dark module-ownership
schema only). ANCHOR-2 / seeding / resolver extension / S6B-PRES / coordinate enablement remain deferred.

## 2026-06-23 — OSN-ANCHOR-1B: empty canonical-anchor schema (`space_anchors`) — DEPLOYED & CLOSED (flag OFF)

Additive, EMPTY, server-only canonical-anchor foundation (branch `osn3-anchor1b-space-anchors`, PR #18 merge
**`7264f12`**, migration **`0063`**). `public.space_anchors`: closed `kind ∈ {base,location}` with **exactly
one real typed owner FK** (`base_id`→`bases` ON DELETE CASCADE, `location_id`→`locations` ON DELETE RESTRICT;
no ownerless / all-null / polymorphic `(kind, owner_uuid)`); coords NOT NULL + finite + within `[-10000,10000]²`
(rejects NULL/NaN/±Inf/oob); partial-unique **one active anchor per base & per location** (no `(space_x,space_y)`
unique — intentional co-location stays possible); BEFORE-UPDATE immutability guard (SECURITY INVOKER,
`search_path=public`: active→retired only; kind/owner/x/y/created_at immutable; retired terminal; DELETE
unguarded so base CASCADE works); private RLS (no policy) + explicit revoke from public/anon/authenticated +
grant **service_role-only**.

**Seeds NOTHING; copies nothing from `bases.x/y`/`locations.x/y`; NOT read by `mainship_space_resolve_origin`
(resolver UNCHANGED → `home`/`at_location`/`legacy_*` still resolve `origin_not_anchored`); no flag/resolver/
docking/movement/UI change.** Proof: disposable real-chain `osn3-anchor1b-realchain-proof.yml` (all 17 points —
shape/types/RLS/indexes/checks/trigger, kinds/owners/coords/uniqueness/immutability, base-cascade, location-
restrict, ACL, resolver-unchanged; asserts table empty) + S1–S6A / DOCK-0 / ANCHOR-1A non-regression + Build,
all GREEN. (Three proofs first failed on a transient Docker-pull `502` at `supabase start` — proof step skipped,
not a defect — and reran green with no code change.)

**Deploy:** production-Environment-gated run **`28025760972`** (approved) applied exactly `0063` ("Finished
supabase db push"); remote migration history now ends **`20260618000063`** (no `0064+`). Live confirm: anon REST
`GET /space_anchors` → HTTP `401` `42501` permission-denied (table **exists** in prod, clients **denied**); flags
`mainship_send_enabled=true`, `mainship_space_movement_enabled=false`. **OSN is now PAUSED at this boundary.**
NEXT: **Main Ship Progression (MSP)** — not ANCHOR-2.

## 2026-06-23 — OSN-ANCHOR-1A: production catalog-parity verification — CLOSED

Verified the deployed truthful-origin resolver `mainship_space_resolve_origin` (migration `0062`) is
**byte-identical + semantically identical to source** in production, via a dedicated, strictly read-only
catalog-parity spotcheck. Built across two PRs: **#16 (`2b11f28`)** added the `osn3-anchor1a-catalog-spotcheck`
workflow + script capability; **#17 (`cb0219a`)** a CA-trust remediation after the first production run failed
`sslmode=verify-full` against the shared IPv4 pooler — pinned the official **Supabase Root 2021 CA**
(`scripts/supabase-prod-ca.crt`, cert SHA-256 `807025ad50d4ed219d2c9c7d299c004f824eb00cf7f65afef607d07b72e6cafa`)
+ used the **session pooler (port 5432)**; kept `verify-full`, **no TLS downgrade**.

Production verification run **`28022976137`** (workflow_dispatch on `main`, production gate approved) PASSED: raw
stored-body `prosrc` SHA-256 `7d4548e64e2fca60a944fe2875c0b8e3e381c85bb0960f14bb8670d71d6038b0` identical
reference-vs-production (exact, no normalization); 17-field descriptor parity identical; invariants OK
(plpgsql / owner=postgres / SECURITY DEFINER / `search_path=public` / service_role-only; anon/authenticated/PUBLIC
denied); remote migration history ends exactly `0062`; read-only gate proven before any catalog query; **no
production write**. Equality source = raw `p.prosrc` (version-stable), NOT `pg_get_functiondef`. Flags unchanged
(send=true, space=false). No resolver/data/flag change.

---

## 2026-06-22 — OSN-ANCHOR-1A: truthful-origin guard (dark) — DEPLOYED & CLOSED (flag OFF)

Migration **`0062`** (branch `osn3-anchor1a-truthful-origin`, PR #15 merge **`fb28481`**) re-creates
`mainship_space_resolve_origin(uuid)` (CREATE OR REPLACE; signature / SECURITY DEFINER / `search_path=public` /
service_role-only all preserved) so `home` / `legacy_home` / `at_location` / `legacy_present` now resolve
**`{ok:false, reason:'origin_not_anchored'}`** instead of reading legacy `bases.x/y` / `locations.x/y` as a
movement origin; `in_space` unchanged (origin = ship `space_x/space_y`); `in_transit`→`must_stop`;
`destroyed`→`destroyed`. Closes the proven defect of legacy dynamic-map coordinates leaking into OSN movement
origins. **NO anchor table, NO bases/locations column, NO seed/backfill, NO legacy fallback; both flags
untouched** (send=true, space=false).

Proof: real chain `0001..0062` (`osn3-anchor1a-realchain-proof.yml`) — the four legacy/home states →
`origin_not_anchored` (no movement / receipt / legacy-origin written); `in_space` success with origin == ship
coord; rejected-request idempotency; resolver ACL/security/signature parity; cross-domain / destruction / DOCK-0
non-regression. Deployed via production-gated run **`27988863386`**; production catalog-parity verification
followed separately (see the 2026-06-23 catalog-parity entry). Coordinate movement stays dark.

## 2026-06-22 — OSN-3 S6C: flag-dark empty-space coordinate command surface — CLOSED (flag OFF)

Frontend-only coordinate-move command path (branch `osn3-s6c-empty-space-coordinate-command`, PR #14 merge
**`9ce5567`**, **no migration / RPC / flag / server change**). Empty-space map tap → `screenToWorld` →
canonicalized target → existing S6A wrapper `command_main_ship_space_move(p_target_x, p_target_y, p_request_id)`.
Layered gating (feature flag `mainship_space_movement_enabled` read once; eligibility; controls/crosshair mount
only when enabled + within bounds; tap qualifies only on empty SVG) → **production-dark**: flag false ⇒ wrapper
returns `feature_disabled` and writes nothing. The client submits **intent only** (target coords + `request_id`);
never a speed/duration/stat/ship-id. Build green; flags unchanged (send=true, space=false). NEXT then was the
S6B presentation foundation + ANCHOR truthful-origin work.

---

## 2026-06-22 — OSN-3 S6B: fixed-space frontend coordinate foundation — CLOSED (flag OFF, read-only)

S6B closes the **read-only frontend coordinate-rendering foundation** for open space across four merged
sub-slices. It is **not** a player-enabled movement feature: coordinate movement remains **production-dark**
(`mainship_space_movement_enabled=false`; `mainship_send_enabled=true`), there is **no player command path,
tap selection, selected-target persistence, or coordinate-movement enablement**, and **no migration / RPC /
flag / server change** in any S6B slice (migrations remain through **0060**).

- **S6B1** (merge `586d67c`) — `src/features/map/openSpaceTransform.ts`: a **pure** fixed-domain transform —
  `worldToViewBox`/`viewBoxToWorld` over `[-10000,10000]→[0,1000]` (explicit Y-inversion), `worldToScreen`/
  `screenToWorld` (camera + `preserveAspectRatio` letterbox), and a **separate** `isWithinOpenSpaceBounds`
  predicate (no hidden clamping; conversions never validate). Verifier `verify:osn:s6b`.
- **S6B2** (merge `f7974ac`) — a **mandatory discriminated** `coordinateSpace: 'legacy_dynamic' |
  'open_space_fixed'` on the resolved `ShipMarker`; the ship's open-space states (`in_space`, coordinate
  `in_transit`) route through the fixed transform while legacy/named states keep `buildNormalizer`.
  Exhaustive switch + `never` guard, no silent legacy fallback. Verifier `verify:osn:resolver`.
- **S6B3** (merge `e2de473`) — a **development-only**, non-interactive fixed-space preview
  (`DevFixedSpacePreview`), gated **solely** by `import.meta.env.DEV` and **compile-time eliminated** from
  the production bundle — proven by `vite build` + a `dist/` grep showing the `s6b3-dev-preview` sentinel
  and the component are **absent** (true removal, not runtime hiding). `pointerEvents:none`, `aria-hidden`,
  minimal hollow ring/crosshair. Verifier `verify-s6b3`.
- **S6B4** (merge `adc7009`) — behavior-preserving extraction of `MainShipMarker`'s routing into a pure
  exported `markerViewBoxPoint(marker, norm)` that **the component and the tests both call** (no duplicate);
  proves a **resolved** `open_space_fixed` marker is projected through `worldToViewBox` (the dynamic `norm`
  is **never** called) and that the preview + a distinct fixed-space ship point **co-move** under the camera
  (screen Δ = letterbox·zoom × viewBox Δ across zoom 0.4/1/2/8 × zero/nonzero pan × square/wide/tall/mobile
  viewports; pure geometry, no comparison to dynamic named-location coords). Verifiers `verify:osn:resolver`
  + `verify:osn:s6b`.

**Acceptance (all green):** `verify:osn:s6b` (transform) · `verify:osn:resolver` (provenance + S6B4 routing)
· `verify-s6b3` (dev preview + production-elimination) · `build` (tsc -b + vite build) · post-merge **Build +
Pages** deploy. On production data the ship marker is always `legacy_dynamic` (open-space states are dark)
and the dev preview is absent → **zero production visual change**.

**Explicitly NOT done / still pending.** Fixed-space markers and legacy named locations are **not yet an
approved co-registered presentation**. **S6B-PRES is mandatory before any S6D enablement** — it must
charter, implement, and prove **either** named locations rendered through a verified fixed-domain transform
**or** a distinct coordinate-navigation map mode where legacy dynamic markers are hidden/non-spatial. No
tap/`mapToWorld` wiring (S6C), no command/CTA/RPC, no flag flip.

**NEXT:** OSN-3 **S6B-PRES** reconnaissance — the fixed-space ↔ named-location presentation decision (the
mandatory pre-S6D gate). S6C input wiring must **not** precede that decision.

## 2026-06-21 — OSN-3 S6A: public coordinate-command boundary (flag-dark) — CLOSED (flag OFF)

First **player-facing** coordinate-movement command surface (branch `osn3-s6a-public-space-move-command`,
no-ff merge **`ac9230a`**, code commit `581dea9`, migration **`0060`**). A narrow, **authenticated**,
SECURITY DEFINER wrapper **`command_main_ship_space_move(p_target_x, p_target_y, p_request_id)`** that
derives the caller from `auth.uid()`, derives the caller's **own** main ship server-side (**no client
player/ship id**), defense-in-depth flag-gates, **canonicalizes** the target to the integer world-unit
grid (`round(numeric)` — half **away from zero**, deterministic; non-finite rejected before the cast;
bounds remain the writer's authority, so a raw value with `|canonical| ≤ 10000` snaps inward and is
accepted), **DELEGATES** to the existing private writer `mainship_space_begin_move`, and **maps** the
result to a narrow player-safe payload. Canonicalization is a discrete-grid concern only — **`p_request_id`
remains the idempotency key**. The private writer stays the **final authority** on flag/ownership/bounds/
state/exclusion/travel-cap/locking/idempotency/movement-creation and remains **service_role-only** (the
client never gains it; the definer-owner `postgres` invokes it). **NO writer/processor/S2/S5 change, NO
new table/cron, NO flag flip, NO UI/CTA.**

**Dark in production:** `mainship_space_movement_enabled` stays **false**, so the wrapper returns
`feature_disabled` and writes nothing → **net player-visible effect: none**. `mainship_send_enabled` stays
**true**; legacy named-location travel is untouched and **mutually exclusive** with coordinate movement
(proven both directions: a coordinate-domain ship rejects legacy send/move by precondition; a legacy-busy
ship rejects the coordinate command via cross-domain exclusion; the fleet `active_movement_id` XOR
`active_space_movement_id` holds).

Also: sibling dev flag tool **`dev-mainship-space-movement-flag.mjs`** (+ workflow) for the coordinate flag
(legacy send-flag tool untouched; **not** run against prod in S6A); **`fetchMainshipSpaceMovementEnabled()`**
typed read in `src/lib/catalog.ts` (no UI wiring — an S6B seed). The migration re-locks the execute surface
(canonical client RPCs **+ the new wrapper**; writer/processor/destruction/S2 helpers stay service_role-only).

**Authoritative proof (real chain `0001..0060`, disposable Supabase; `osn3-s6a-realchain-proof.yml`).**
GREEN: permission/boundary (wrapper authenticated-only, owner postgres / SECURITY DEFINER / search_path
public / no dynamic SQL / no player-or-ship param; private writer + S4 + S5 + four S2 helpers
service_role-only; canonical client-RPC inventory = prior 13 **+** the wrapper); runtime **SET ROLE** (anon
denied / authenticated allowed on the wrapper; writer client-denied, service_role-allowed); fixture matrix
(dark→`feature_disabled` + no write; success from home/in_space/at_location; canonicalization
half-away-from-zero + near-edge inward snap + `out_of_bounds`/non-finite reject; `zero_distance`;
idempotency exact **and** equivalent-canonical replay + `request_conflict` + no duplicate; state matrix
`in_transit→must_stop_first` / `destroyed→ship_destroyed` / legacy-busy`→busy_legacy`; legacy↔coordinate
mutual exclusion both directions + fleet pointer XOR); REST boundary (private writer rejected for anon **and**
authenticated; wrapper reachable for authenticated but dark → `feature_disabled`, no movement). Flags
restored `if: always()`.

**Gates (all green):** S6A real-chain proof; **S1–S5 real-chain regression**; Build (`tsc -b` + `vite
build`); `deploy-migrations` (live `db push` of 0060); post-deploy integration **Verify**; live legacy
regressions `verify-mainship-send` (send **+ return/recall**), `verify-mainship-move`,
`verify-mainship-repair`. **Live read-only spot check** (`osn3-s6a-live-spotcheck.yml`): 0060 applied;

one S4 arrival cron @30s; `mainship_send_enabled=true`, `mainship_space_movement_enabled=false`, cap=86400;
`main_ship_space_movements=0`, `command_receipts=0` — **no game-state mutation by the deploy**. (An earlier
batch of live runs was **cancelled** by the shared `live-db-tests` concurrency group — a workflow-concurrency
incident, not a test failure; each was re-run serially to a real `success`.)

**NEXT (not started, needs approval):** OSN-3 **S6B** — the fixed-domain paired coordinate transform
(`worldToMap`/`mapToWorld` over `[-10000,10000]`, Y-inverting, pan/zoom-aware) **+ a read-only target
preview**, still flag-off. No map tap/CTA until S6C; no enablement until S6D; OSN-4 Stop remains deferred.

## 2026-06-21 — OSN-3 S5: coordinate-complete trusted destruction primitive — CLOSED (flag OFF)

Fifth **OSN-3** slice (branch `osn3-s5-destruction-hardening`, approved head `a7ab585`, normal **no-ff**
merge **`0d84256`**, migration **`0059`**; final `main == origin/main == fda8778` after a read-only
live-spot-check tooling commit). **Narrow hardening only — NO public RPC, NO UI, NO new processor/cron,
NO Return/Stop, NO generic reconciliation, NO flag change.** Both flags untouched (`mainship_send_enabled`
stays **true**, `mainship_space_movement_enabled` stays **false**).

**The defect S5 fixes.** `dev_set_main_ship_destroyed(p_player uuid)` — the **unique** trusted main-ship
destruction writer (audited: the only fn that sets `main_ship_instances.status='destroyed'`/`hp=0`;
combat destroys legacy unit-fleets via `fleet_destroy`, never main ships; `repair_main_ship` only
recovers) — predated the coordinate domain and therefore could **not** destroy a ship in a valid
coordinate state without violating a coordinate constraint (`in_transit` left
`fleets.active_space_movement_id` set → violates `fleets_active_space_movement_requires_moving`;
`in_space`/`at_location` left a non-null `spatial_state` → violates the `…_ss_*_status` CHECKs). Latent
(service_role-only path; coordinate movement dark), but closed before coordinate movement is ever enabled.

**Migration 0059** re-creates **only** `dev_set_main_ship_destroyed` (same signature, `SECURITY DEFINER`,
owner `postgres`, `search_path=public`, **service_role-only**, no player wrapper, no new cron). It:
acquires `mainship_space_lock_context(id,false)` first (canonical order; never locks `fleet_movements`);
requires `validate_context` ok — **any generic contradiction ABORTS atomically with all rows unchanged**;
for a coherent `in_transit` cancels the active coordinate movement → `status='cancelled'`,
`terminal_reason='ship_destroyed'`, `resolved_at` (history preserved); clears `active_space_movement_id`;
preserves the existing legacy cleanup; and sets the ship `destroyed`/`hp=0`/**`spatial_state=NULL`**/
`space_x`/`space_y` NULL (NULL — not `'destroyed'` — so `repair_main_ship`, which sets `status='home'`
without resetting `spatial_state`, stays valid → a repaired ship is a clean `legacy_home`). The S3 command
receipt is immutable; no history deletion. `repair_main_ship`, the S4 processor, the S3 writer, the S2
helpers, and all legacy writers are untouched; migrations `0052/0055/0056/0057/0058` are untouched.

**Authoritative proof (real chain `0001..0059`, disposable Supabase; `osn3-s5-realchain-proof.yml`).**
GREEN at `a7ab585`: coherent destruction of `in_transit` (movement→cancelled/ship_destroyed, receipt
immutable), `in_space`, `at_location`, and preserved `legacy_present`; idempotent repeated destruction;
**real `repair_main_ship` after destruction → clean `legacy_home`** with no coordinate residue; the full
contradiction-abort matrix (active legacy movement, unexpected presence, pointer/ownership mismatch,
multiple fleets, in_transit-without-movement, destroyed-plus-moving) each non-mutating; real
concurrent-session races (arrival-wins-then-destroy-clears-`in_space`; destruction-wins-arrival-never-
settles-cancelled; two destructions race → one terminal, second idempotent); runtime ACL + SET ROLE
denial; REST/RPC denial of the primitive + processor + writer + S2 helpers for anon and a real
authenticated JWT. *Root-cause note:* the first run was red only on a **proof-harness** transaction
defect (concurrency sessB ran destruction in autocommit, never observed idle-in-transaction); fixed by
holding sessB's destruction in a txn — **the migration/primitive needed no change** (no `0060`).

**Gates (all green at `a7ab585`):** S5 real-chain proof; S1/S2/S3/S4 real-chain regression; the Build
gate via draft PR #3 (`npm ci`, lint, `tsc -b`, `vite build`); `verify:osn:resolver`; the legacy-send
read-only verifier. **Live read-only spot check** (`osn3-s5-live-spotcheck.yml`, post-deploy): 0059
applied; primitive present with the approved signature (`p_player uuid`), owner=postgres, SECURITY
DEFINER, search_path=public, no dynamic SQL, no player wrapper, service_role-only; canonical client-RPC
inventory unchanged; `repair_main_ship` still authenticated-executable; S2 helpers + S3 writer + S4
processor non-client-executable; exactly one S4 arrival cron @ `30 seconds` (cadence unchanged);
`mainship_send_enabled=true`, `mainship_space_movement_enabled=false`, `max_coordinate_travel_seconds=86400`;
`main_ship_space_movements=0`, `main_ship_space_command_receipts=0` — no game-state mutation by the deploy
or verification.

**Scope confirmation.** S5 added **no** player coordinate RPC, UI, processor/cron, Return, Stop, generic
reconciliation, history cleanup/retention, legacy-writer change, `repair_main_ship` change, S2/S3/S4
helper change, or feature enablement. The internal coordinate lifecycle is now complete and dark:
**departure (S3) → arrival settlement (S4) → parked `in_space` → coordinate-complete destruction (S5)**.
**NEXT (not started, awaiting a separate explicit charter):** a PC-first coordinate command/map surface
(public wrapper + UI, gated by `mainship_space_movement_enabled`), then **OSN-4 Stop**.

## 2026-06-21 — OSN-3 S4: coordinate-arrival processor — CLOSED (flag OFF)

Fourth **OSN-3** slice (branch `osn3-s4-arrival-processor`, approved head `33588e2`, normal **no-ff**
merge **`6b1a88e`**, migration **`0058`**; final `main == origin/main == 6b1a88e`). **One private,
server-only background PROCESSOR — still NO public RPC, NO UI, NO Return/Stop, NO feature enablement,
NO reconciliation/destruction.** `mainship_space_movement_enabled` stays **false** (the processor does
not gate on it); `mainship_send_enabled` stays **true** (untouched legacy path).

**Migration 0058 — `public.process_mainship_space_arrivals() returns integer`.** One `SECURITY DEFINER`,
owner `postgres`, `search_path=public`, **service_role-only** processor (PUBLIC/anon/authenticated
revoked; no player wrapper), driven by a **pg_cron** job `process-mainship-space-arrivals` at the
established **`30 seconds`** cadence (`command = select public.process_mainship_space_arrivals();`,
idempotent unschedule-by-name). It settles each due, still-coherent S3 coordinate movement **exactly
once**: non-locking candidate scan (`status='moving' and arrive_at<=now()`, `ORDER BY arrive_at,id LIMIT
100`) → per ship `mainship_space_lock_context(id, true)` skip-locked (S2 canonical order ship → fleet →
coordinate-movement → presence; never locks legacy `fleet_movements`) → `validate_context` must be
`in_transit` → `assert_cross_domain_exclusion` → re-confirm under lock → atomic settlement.

- **Arrival transition:** movement **`moving → arrived`** (`resolved_at=now()`,
  `terminal_reason='auto_arrival'`; immutable origin/target/speed/time history preserved); fleet
  **`moving → completed`** with `location_mode='movement'` and `active_space_movement_id` /
  `active_movement_id` / `current_*` cleared (truthful open-space terminal — verified legal once the
  space pointer is NULL; no base field set, `fleet_complete()` not used); ship **`traveling`/`in_transit`
  → `stationary`/`in_space`** at the movement's `target_x`/`target_y`.
- **Terminal history preserved** (the `arrived` row stays; existing FK CASCADE cleans it only on
  owner/ship deletion — no retention/cleanup job added). The S3 creation receipt is immutable; S4 writes
  no receipt and creates/leaves no `location_presence`.
- **Contradiction policy (frozen):** every contradiction / malformed / destroyed / legacy-conflict /
  presence-conflict / pointer-mismatch / ownership-mismatch / not-due / already-terminal case is left
  **untouched** with a concise log (no settle/fail/repair/normalize/delete; hardening deferred to S5).
- **Flag rule:** the processor never reads `mainship_space_movement_enabled` (so disabling it can't
  strand in-transit ships) and never touches `mainship_send_enabled`.

**Authoritative proof (real chain `0001..0058`, disposable Supabase; `osn3-s4-realchain-proof.yml`).**
GREEN at `33588e2`: due settles exactly once; not-yet-due stays moving; second call settles 0
(idempotent); two concurrent processors settle once (loser skip-locked); skip-locked ship skipped then
settles; settlement proceeds with the space flag FALSE; full arrival-state assertions (movement
arrived/`auto_arrival`/`resolved`, ship `stationary`/`in_space` at exact target, fleet `completed`/
`movement` with pointers+base cleared, no presence, no legacy mv, S2 `validate_context`=`in_space`, S3
receipt unchanged, terminal history present); the seven contradiction cases each proven non-mutating
(per-ship state hash) as real due candidates; runtime ACL + SET ROLE denial; REST/RPC denial of the
processor + writer + S2 helpers for anon and a real authenticated JWT; cron asserted present once @30s;
cleanup + flags/cap/cron restored & asserted. *Root-cause note:* the first proof run was red on a
**fixture** timestamp assumption only (transaction-scoped `now()` made `arrive_at < depart_at`),
corrected by moving both timestamps into the past + asserting every fixture's precondition; **the
processor/0058 needed no change** (no `0059`).

**Gates (all green at `33588e2`):** S4 real-chain proof; S1/S2/S3 real-chain regression; the Build gate
via draft PR #2 (`npm ci`, lint, `tsc -b`, `vite build`); `verify:osn:resolver`; the legacy-send
read-only activation verifier. **Live read-only spot check** (`osn3-s4-live-spotcheck.yml`, post-deploy):
0058 applied; processor present with the approved signature (no args), owner=postgres, SECURITY DEFINER,
search_path=public, no dynamic SQL, no player wrapper, service_role-only (anon/authenticated/PUBLIC
denied); S3 writer + four S2 helpers service_role-only; canonical client-RPC inventory unchanged;
anon/authenticated cannot CREATE in `public`; **exactly one** cron job `process-mainship-space-arrivals`
@ `30 seconds` (no duplicate); `mainship_send_enabled=true`, `mainship_space_movement_enabled=false`,
`max_coordinate_travel_seconds=86400`; **`main_ship_space_movements`=0 and
`main_ship_space_command_receipts`=0** — live deployment created zero coordinate movements and zero
receipts; no game-state side effect (a natural cron tick that finds zero due movements is harmless).

**Scope confirmation.** S4 added **no** player coordinate RPC, UI, Return, Stop, reconciliation/auto-
repair, destruction/repair behavior, history cleanup/retention, legacy-writer/processor change, S2/S3
helper change, or feature enablement. `mainship_send_enabled=true` remains the temporary playable legacy
named-location path; `mainship_space_movement_enabled=false` remains dark. **NEXT (not started, awaiting
a separate explicit S5 charter):** reconciler / destruction hardening (S5) → target UI (S7) → a public
player wrapper for the writer → **OSN-4 Stop** (S8).

## 2026-06-21 — Legacy main-ship send: controlled production activation (config-only, reversible)

Enabled the **already-built legacy named-location** main-ship travel path on live by flipping **one**
game-config key via the established controlled workflow `dev-mainship-flag.yml` →
`scripts/dev-mainship-flag.mjs --enabled true` (writes only `mainship_send_enabled` via the owned
`set_game_config`). **No migration, no code/UI change, no fixtures, no test users, no writer execution.**

**Target/result live config:** `mainship_send_enabled = true`, **`mainship_space_movement_enabled =
false`** (untouched), `max_coordinate_travel_seconds = 86400` (untouched). The activation script logged
`Before: false → After: true`.

**Read-only preflight** (`osn3-s3-live-spotcheck`, run `27899732391`): confirmed the pre-state —
send=false, space=false, cap=86400, `main_ship_space_movements`=0, `main_ship_space_command_receipts`=0,
S3 writer + four S2 helpers service_role-only, canonical client-RPC inventory unchanged. **Read-only
post-activation verification** (`osn3-legacy-send-activation-check`, run `27899841147`): confirmed
send=true, space_movement=false, cap=86400, `main_ship_space_movements`=0, `command_receipts`=0, and
that `mainship_space_begin_move` + the four S2 helpers remain **service_role-only / non-client-executable**
with the canonical client-RPC inventory unchanged and `public`-schema CREATE denied to anon/authenticated.

**What this does / does not do.** It re-exposes only the **legacy named-location** player capability
(`send_main_ship_expedition` base→location, `move_main_ship_to_location` location→location, plus the
always-available recovery paths `request_main_ship_return` and `repair_main_ship`). It does **not**
enable coordinate movement or any OSN player command: the S3 coordinate writer stays service_role-only
and flag-dark (`mainship_space_movement_enabled=false`), no coordinate UI/command surface exists, and no
coordinate movement or command receipt was created (both counts remain 0). No game-state row was created
or modified by the activation. **Rollback** is the same controlled workflow with
`mainship_send_enabled=false` (single-key, instant, no migration). **S4 has not started.**

---

## 2026-06-21 — OSN-3 S3: first internal coordinate-movement writer — CLOSED (flag OFF)

Third **OSN-3** slice (branch `osn3-s3-begin-move-writer`, approved head `e267eee`, normal **no-ff**
merge **`f4ba07e`**, migration **`0057`**; final `main == origin/main == f4ba07e`). **One private,
server-only WRITER — still NO public RPC, NO UI, NO processor, NO arrival/Return/Stop, NO feature
enablement.** Both flags stay false on live.

**Migration 0057 — `public.mainship_space_begin_move(p_player uuid, p_main_ship_id uuid, p_target_x
double precision, p_target_y double precision, p_request_id uuid) returns jsonb`.** One `SECURITY
DEFINER`, owner `postgres`, `search_path=public`, **service_role-only** function (PUBLIC/anon/
authenticated revoked) that composes the deployed S2 boundary — `mainship_space_lock_context` →
`mainship_space_validate_context` → `mainship_space_assert_cross_domain_exclusion` →
`mainship_space_resolve_origin` — to begin exactly one coordinate move. Hard-gated on
`mainship_space_movement_enabled` (stays false); `mainship_send_enabled` untouched. Adds one additive
non-flag guard `max_coordinate_travel_seconds=86400` (the `[-10000,10000]²` envelope is the distance
bound; no `MAX_COORDINATE_MOVE_DISTANCE`).

- **Supported stationary origins:** `home`/`legacy_home`/`in_space` (materialise a new main-ship fleet
  in-txn) and `at_location`/`legacy_present` (reuse the present fleet, closing its active presence).
  **Space-only target contract** (`target_kind='space'` + `p_target_x`/`p_target_y` + `p_request_id`);
  the client never supplies origin/player/ownership/state/fleet/speed/ETA/status or screen coords.
- **One atomic transaction, canonical S2 lock order** (ship → fleet → coordinate-movement → presence);
  never locks legacy `fleet_movements`; never calls a frozen legacy writer. Creates one `moving`
  `main_ship_space_movements` row + coherent fleet pointer (`active_space_movement_id`, legacy
  `active_movement_id` stays NULL) + ship `traveling`/`in_transit` + finalised idempotency receipt.
- **Idempotency** via `main_ship_space_command_receipts (main_ship_id, request_id)`: same id + same
  canonical payload hash → replays the committed `result_json`; same id + changed payload →
  `request_id_payload_conflict`; rejections write no receipt.
- **Validate-before-mutate:** every admission rejection (incl. `travel_time_exceeds_limit`) returns
  `{ok:false,reason}` *before* any write — no rejection leaves an orphan fleet/movement/ship/presence/
  receipt; only a genuine integrity fault raises and rolls back.

**Authoritative proof (real chain `0001..0057`, disposable Supabase; `osn3-s3-realchain-proof.yml`).**
GREEN at `e267eee`: positives from all five origins (each asserting `movement.origin == resolved
origin`, `speed_used == resolve_fleet_movement_speed(fleet)`, coherent fleet/ship/receipt, presence
closed once); the full rejection matrix each proven non-mutating; idempotent replay + payload conflict;
real concurrent-session races (two distinct → one move, loser rejects after revalidation; two
same-request retries → identical committed receipt); `travel_time_exceeds_limit` with explicit
no-effect; runtime ACL + SET ROLE denial; REST/RPC denial of the writer + S2 helpers for anon and a
real authenticated JWT; cleanup + flags/cap restored & asserted. *Root-cause note:* the first proof run
was red on a **fixture** assumption only (the real chain auto-provisions a Home Base at (0,0) via
`initialize_new_player`, so the zero-distance fixture's hard-coded target was wrong) — corrected by
deriving every origin from `mainship_space_resolve_origin`; **the writer/0057 needed no change** (no
`0058`).

**Gates (all green at `e267eee`):** S3 real-chain proof; S1 trigger/FK + S2 real-chain regression; the
Build gate via draft PR #1 (`npm ci`, lint, `tsc -b`, `vite build`); `verify:osn:resolver` (resolver
unit suite). **Live read-only spot check** (`osn3-s3-live-spotcheck.yml`, post-deploy): 0057 applied;
writer present with the exact approved signature, owner=postgres, SECURITY DEFINER, search_path=public,
no dynamic SQL, `acl={postgres,service_role}` (anon/authenticated/PUBLIC denied); four S2 helpers
service_role-only; canonical client-RPC inventory unchanged; anon/authenticated cannot CREATE in
`public`; `mainship_send_enabled=false`, `mainship_space_movement_enabled=false`,
`max_coordinate_travel_seconds=86400`; **`main_ship_space_movements`=0 and
`main_ship_space_command_receipts`=0** — no coordinate movement created live, no game-state side effect.
No fixtures/users/movements/receipts created by the deployment.

**Scope confirmation.** S3 added **no** public player RPC, UI, processor/cron, arrival settlement,
Return, Stop, reconciler, repair/destruction, legacy-writer change, S2-helper change, or feature
enablement. **NEXT (not started, awaiting a separate explicit S4 charter):** arrival processor (S4) →
reconciler/destruction hardening (S5) → target UI (S7) → OSN-4 Stop (S8).

## 2026-06-21 — OSN-3 S2: internal transition boundary + validation core — CLOSED (flag OFF)

Second **OSN-3** slice (branch `osn3-s2-transition-core`, approved head `1f2c45d`, normal **no-ff** merge
`93cb977`, migration `0056`). **Private, server-only transition boundary — NO movement writer, NO
processor, NO Stop, NO UI, NO public RPC, NO flag change.** Current `main == origin/main == a38247f`
(the four commits after `93cb977` changed **only** read-only live-verification tooling:
`.github/workflows/osn3-s2-live-spotcheck.yml`, `scripts/osn3-s2-live-spotcheck.sh`,
`scripts/osn3-s2-live-inspect.sql`). No history rewrite / force-push / rebase / squash / reset.

**Migration 0056 — four `SECURITY DEFINER` helpers (server-only), the locking/validation core for the
future coordinate-move writer (S3+):**
- `public.mainship_space_lock_context(uuid, boolean)` — acquires per-ship locks in the canonical order
  `main_ship_instances → fleets → main_ship_space_movements → location_presence`; never locks legacy
  `fleet_movements` (non-locking `EXISTS` read only); `boolean` = skip-lock (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`
  at the ship row → returns `skipped` with no downstream locks).
- `public.mainship_space_validate_context(uuid)` — validates the full ship/fleet/pointer/presence state.
- `public.mainship_space_resolve_origin(uuid)` — resolves the move origin from current authoritative state.
- `public.mainship_space_assert_cross_domain_exclusion(uuid)` — enforces the legacy/coordinate domain
  mutual exclusion.
All are owned by `postgres`, `set search_path = public`, and relocked so `PUBLIC`/`anon`/`authenticated`
have **no** EXECUTE; `service_role` only. None is exposed as a player-facing PostgREST/RPC function. The
canonical client-RPC grants survived the relock intact; `anon`/`authenticated` cannot CREATE in `public`.

**Authoritative proof (real migration chain, off the shared DB).** A disposable local Supabase stack
applied the actual chain `0001..0056` (`osn3-s2-realchain-proof.yml`). Real concurrent psql sessions
(FIFO-driven, `pg_stat_activity` wait-state + `FOR UPDATE NOWAIT` probes) proved the runtime lock
sequence stage-by-stage (`osn3-s2-realchain-lockorder.sh`), plus blocking vs. skip-lock behavior, the
legacy `fleet_movements` non-locking path, valid/contradictory state fixtures, cross-domain exclusions,
ownership/pointer/presence mismatches, origin resolution, no-mutation (md5 before/after), fixture
cleanup, and runtime REST/RPC denial under `anon`/`authenticated` (`osn3-s2-realchain-perm.sql`,
`-fixtures.sql`, `-rest.sh`). The earlier reduced `postgres:15` stub proof
(`osn3-s2-transition-proof.yml`) is demoted to **supplementary / non-gating**.

**Live read-only spot check (`osn3-s2-live-spotcheck.yml`, run passed).** Method = `migration list` +
`db dump` (corroboration) + an **authoritative direct catalog query** (pure `SELECT`s over
`pg_catalog`/`game_config` + one `count`, via the Supabase pooler `aws-1-ap-southeast-1`) + REST reads.
Confirmed on live: `0056` applied; all four helpers present with approved signatures, `owner=postgres`,
`prosecdef=t`, `search_path=public`, `acl={postgres,service_role}` (no PUBLIC/anon/authenticated EXECUTE);
canonical 13-RPC inventory preserved; `anon` keeps `get_world_map`; no helper authenticated-executable;
schema CREATE denied to client roles; **`mainship_send_enabled=false`**, **`mainship_space_movement_enabled=false`**;
**`main_ship_space_movements` row count = 0**. *Note:* `supabase db dump` is `--no-owner` and lossy for
privileges, so owner/ACL facts come from the direct catalog query (authoritative); the dump only
corroborates presence/`SECURITY DEFINER`/`search_path`. No test users, fixtures, game-state rows,
coordinate movements, or flag changes were created during deployment or verification — strictly read-only.

**Scope confirmation.** S2 added **no** coordinate-movement writer, no coordinate return, no arrival
settlement, no processor/cron, no Stop, no target UI, no public movement RPC, no public grant, no
reconciler, no repair/destruction change, no legacy-writer change, no feature enablement, no frontend
change. **NEXT (not started, awaiting a separate explicit S3 charter):** begin-move RPC (S3) → arrival
processor (S4) → reconciler/destruction hardening (S5) → target UI (S7) → OSN-4 Stop (S8).

## 2026-06-21 — OSN-3 S1: coordinate-domain schema + invariants + read-model — CLOSED (flag OFF)

First **OSN-3** implementation slice (merge commit `90637d6`, branch `osn3-s1-schema-read`, migration
`0055`). **Schema + read-model only — NO movement writers, NO processor, NO UI, NO Stop.** Both flags
stay false (`mainship_send_enabled`, new `mainship_space_movement_enabled`). Builds on OSN-2 (the
durable open-space position model). Five design gates (A → A3.2) preceded it; all blockers resolved.

**Mandatory preflight (proven before deploy).** A disposable `postgres:15` CI container
(`scripts/osn3-s1-trigger-proof.sql` + `osn3-s1-schema-proof.sql`, workflow `osn3-s1-trigger-proof.yml`)
proved, on the real engine but off the shared DB: the `fleets.main_ship_id` **write-once** trigger
(rejects reassignment / late-attach / ordinary detach), that `ON DELETE SET NULL` fires **after** the
parent ship row is gone (so the trigger permits parent-deletion orphaning and existing user/ship
hard-delete cleanup keeps working), and the full §5.1 constraint matrix. *Bug found by the proof:* the
cyclic `fleets ⇄ main_ship_space_movements` FK graph tripped a constraint mid-cascade on a direct ship
delete → fixed by making `fleets.active_space_movement_id` FK **`DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED`**.

**Migration 0055 (additive, transactional).**
- `main_ship_space_movements` — the coordinate route engine, **separate** from frozen `fleet_movements`
  so `process_fleet_movements` can never claim it. `target_kind` ∈ space|location|base with an explicit
  id-iff-kind CHECK; all coords finite + within `[-10000,10000]²`; `speed_used` finite>0; `arrive>depart`;
  status/`resolved_at` integrity; one-active partial-uniques per ship & per fleet; due-arrival index;
  owner-read RLS, no client write; FKs cascade on ship/fleet/user.
- `fleets.active_space_movement_id` (+ FK DEFERRABLE) — the honest moving-fleet pointer; mutual-exclusion
  with `active_movement_id` + requires-moving/movement CHECKs; one-fleet-per-movement unique.
- `main_ship_space_command_receipts` — `UNIQUE(main_ship_id,request_id)` + `canonical_payload_hash`;
  RLS on, **no** client read/write (server-only).
- `main_ship_instances.status += 'stationary'` + six legacy-safe forward lifecycle CHECKs (the reverse
  `stationary` rule uses `… IS TRUE` to reject `stationary`+NULL). No reverse rules for legacy statuses;
  no back-fill (existing rows stay `spatial_state=NULL`).
- write-once `fleets.main_ship_id` trigger; `mainship_space_movement_enabled=false`; execute relock.

**Read-model (the SINGLE resolver, extended — no second resolver).** `resolveMainShipMarker` now reads
the already-deployed coordinate states: `in_transit` (interpolate the active `main_ship_space_movements`
row, fully validated against ship/fleet/pointer/timestamps/presence), `at_location` (validated present
fleet + matching active presence), and `home` (base, no active state). Legacy `NULL` behavior unchanged;
any contradiction → `null`. A new owner-read fetch of the active coordinate movement runs inside the
existing 4s poll; the fleet read gains `location_mode`/`active_movement_id`/`active_space_movement_id`.

**Verification (all green via CI; local toolchain unusable).** Disposable trigger+schema proofs ✓;
branch closure (`npm run lint` + `tsc -b` + `vite build` + resolver unit tests **32/32**) ✓; migration
deploy ✓; phase8 engine regression ✓; live `verify:osn3:s1` **13/13** (both flags false, RLS owner-read,
client writes denied, receipts unreadable, write-once trigger live, **0 coordinate rows**) ✓; live
`spatial_state` distribution **56/56 NULL**. No writer/processor/UI/reconciler/repair/legacy change.
**NEXT (not started):** shared transition boundary → begin-move RPC (S3) → arrival processor (S4) →
reconciler/destruction hardening (S5) → target UI (S7) → OSN-4 Stop (S8). `MAX_COORDINATE_MOVE_DISTANCE`
/ `MAX_COORDINATE_TRAVEL_SECONDS` and the emergency processor-pause contract are deferred to those slices.

## 2026-06-21 — OSN-1 / OSN-2a / OSN-2b (Open-Space Navigation, read side) — CLOSED

Cross-cutting **Open-Space Navigation (OSN)** initiative (see `MAINSHIP_TRANSITION.md` §12). These
stages add the main ship's single position model and a durable open-space coordinate — **read/schema
only, no movement writers yet**. `mainship_send_enabled` stays **false**; engine + legacy paths frozen.
(Builds on the earlier, separately-recorded main-ship transition 10C–10H + direct A→B move, which live
in `MAINSHIP_TRANSITION.md` §7 rather than this log.)

**OSN-1 — read-only main-ship map marker (commit `727388f`).** New pure resolver
`src/features/map/resolveMainShipMarker.ts` (single source of main-ship display position: home→base,
present→location, moving/returning→interpolate active movement clamp 0..1, destroyed→null,
in-flight-without-movement→null no-teleport) + `MainShipMarker.tsx` (pointer-transparent, 1s tick only
while moving) + Playwright unit test. Flag-gated; camera/command paths untouched.

**OSN-2a — durable open-space position SCHEMA (commits `1f844e9`, `9534319`; migration `0054`).** Added
nullable-no-default `main_ship_instances.spatial_state` + `space_x`/`space_y` (double precision) as the
single authoritative owner of a "stopped in open space" coordinate. CHECKs: domain
`NULL|home|at_location|in_transit|in_space|destroyed`; coords both-null-or-both-set; coords present IFF
`in_space`; finite-only (reject NaN/±Inf). **No back-fill** — existing ships stay `spatial_state=NULL`
(legacy; position still from base/fleet/movement/presence). No functions → no relock; RLS/grants
unchanged (owner-read, no client write). `verify:osn2` 23/23. *Bug fixed:* ASI hazard (regex at
statement start) in the verifier (`9534319`).

**OSN-2b — resolver reads the new columns, read-model only (commits `bfebb1f`, `30289fe`, `f400ee4`,
`17ceb51`, `8a9518d`).** Extended the **single** resolver (no second resolver): `in_space`→ship-owned
`space_x/space_y` (finite, no active fleet/presence); `NULL`→legacy, with the named-location path now
deterministic (requires fleet `present` + `current_location_id` + matching ACTIVE `location_presence` +
resolvable location, else null); destroyed/contradiction/other→null. Read-side plumbing only:
`MainShipLite` + owner-read select gain the 3 columns; `fetchActiveMainShipPresence` (narrow: linked
`fleet_id` + `status='active'`, 3 fields, limit 1) runs inside the existing poll; `GalaxyMap` threads
presence into the marker. No writer/migration/RPC/flag/status/reconciler/destruction/lock change.

**Closure verification (commit `8a9518d`).** `@playwright/test` pinned **exactly `1.61.0`** (devDep +
lockfile); resolver test runs via `npm ci` (dropped ad-hoc `npm install --no-save`); on-demand strict
closure workflow runs **full `npm run lint` + `tsc -b` + `vite build` + resolver test**, all green;
read-only `verify:osn2:distribution` confirmed the live distribution is **54/54 `spatial_state=NULL`**
(zero `in_space`/`home`/`at_location`/`in_transit`/`destroyed` — no live ship hidden by the resolver).
*Bugs fixed during closure:* resolver workflow missing Playwright install → exit 127 (`30289fe`);
violet `in_space` marker color reverted — it was `LocationMarker`'s derelict-station color, not main-ship
visual language (`f400ee4`); two pre-existing `Date.now()`-during-render eslint errors
(`MainShipPanel.tsx`, `MainShipMarker.tsx`) fixed via the existing `now`-in-state tick so full repo lint
is green (`17ceb51`).

**Local toolchain note:** the dev machine cannot run lint/tsc/build/playwright locally (OneDrive
`node_modules` corruption + TLS-intercepting proxy); all verification runs in CI. Migrations through
**0054**. **NEXT:** OSN-3 (arbitrary-coordinate movement) — Design Gate A produced; 4 open decisions
before schema slice S1 (see the OSN-3 design report / `MAINSHIP_TRANSITION.md`).

## 2026-06-19 — Design correction: HIGH-STAKES ships (destructible) + emergency restart (docs)

**Decision (replaces "never destroyed + self-repair"):** main ships are persistent but **NOT
immortal** — they **can be permanently destroyed** (gone/retired) for real strategic stakes.
**Safelock rule: permanent ship loss is allowed; permanent account lockout is not.** When a
player has **zero usable main ships**, grant **one weak emergency starter ship** (starter hull,
**no modules, no captain bonuses, basic readiness, restart-only**) — does NOT restore the
destroyed ship, does NOT refund resources, gated by **strict eligibility + cooldown** (no farming;
a player with any usable ship is ineligible). Future defeat consequences: destroyed ship lost ·
cargo/rewards lost · modules lost/damaged/salvaged later · captains injured/rescued/captured later
· surviving ships keep going.

**Docs only (`MAINSHIP_TRANSITION.md`):** rewrote §6 anti-softlock to the high-stakes
destructible-ship + emergency-restart model; updated the fix-direction, softlock-coupling note,
§5 model (defeat = possible permanent destruction; surviving ships remain), the ★ vision
(persistent ≠ immortal), §8 residual-softlock (zero-ships → mandatory emergency replacement;
airtight eligibility), §9 (no destruction/replacement in 10C; both ship together in 10E), and the
phase table — **10C stays NON-COMBAT-only (no destruction)**; **10E renamed to destruction &
safelock** (permanent destruction + emergency-replacement RPC).

**Not implemented.** No code, no migration, no combat change. 10C not started (awaiting separate
approval). Backend unchanged.

---

## 2026-06-18 — Design correction: deprecate support capacity / support craft (UI + docs)

**Decision:** support capacity / support craft is **no longer part of the byeharu vision**. The
core is **multiple persistent main ships + captains + modules + upgrades**. Remove support
**safely** (hide → stop depending → delete), not by sudden deletion. This step: **hide from UI +
mark deprecated in docs.** No backend change, no migration, no deletes.

**Docs (`MAINSHIP_TRANSITION.md`):** added a ⚠️ deprecation callout in the ★ vision (support is
dormant scaffolding, not core; loadout = captains/modules/upgrades, no support craft, no
capacity budget); revised the model + 10D wording; added a **"9b. Removing support — later"**
safe-order section (hide → stop depending → deprecate fns → drop schema last).

**UI (10B preview revised → "Main Ship" read-only view):** `MainShipPreview.tsx` now shows the
**main ship only** — name, hull, status, readiness (hp/max_hp), speed, cargo, captain slots,
module slots. **Removed: support-craft picker, support-capacity bar, support-loadout wording,
activity selector.** `mainshipApi.ts` rewritten to read `main_ship_instances` (owner-read) +
`main_ship_hull_types` (public) directly — dropped `fetchSupportCraftTypes` /
`fetchExpeditionPreview` (the support-laden client wrappers). Galaxy toggle relabeled
"🛰 Main Ship". Still strictly read-only; no writes.

**Backend: UNCHANGED.** No migration. `get_my_expedition_preview`, `calculate_expedition_stats`,
`support_craft_types`, and the `support_capacity` columns stay in place but **dormant + unused by
the UI**. (`verify:mainship-preview` still exercises the dormant RPC — left as a backend
regression.) **Remaining support dependencies (to remove in a later phase):** `support_craft_types`
table (Phase 6 + `verify-phase6`); `calculate_expedition_stats` support math (Phase 8) +
`get_my_expedition_preview` wrapper (Phase 10B); `support_capacity`/`base_support_capacity`
columns; a non-displayed `support_capacity` read in `useGalaxyMapData` (Phase 9A). **Recommended
later removal phase:** after the captain/module/upgrade stat source replaces the support layer
and no live path calls it. **Docs + UI only; not pushed; no CI run.**

---

## 2026-06-18 — Phase 10B: read-only main-ship expedition preview (implemented; pending verify)

**Scope: strict preview only** — see what your main ship + a support-craft loadout WOULD bring.
No writes, no sending, no combat/engine change; the Phase 9B send path is untouched. Per
`docs/MAINSHIP_TRANSITION.md` (10B).

**Migration `0049_mainship_preview.sql`** — `get_my_expedition_preview(p_loadout jsonb,
p_activity_type text)` → jsonb. **STABLE (read-only)**, SECURITY DEFINER, `auth.uid()`-scoped,
granted to **authenticated**. Reuses the **single stat source** `calculate_expedition_stats`
(Phase 8, stays server-only — the wrapper calls it as the definer; not exposed to clients).
- Ship exists → `{has_ship:true, valid:true, ship, stats}`.
- Validation errors (over-capacity / unknown craft / bad qty) are **caught** → `{valid:false,
  error}` (a preview warning, not a client crash).
- No ship yet → `{has_ship:false, hull:…}` starter-hull teaser. **It does NOT commission a
  ship** (no write) — commissioning is a later phase.

**Frontend (read-only):** `mainshipApi.ts` (`fetchSupportCraftTypes`, `fetchExpeditionPreview`);
`MainShipPreview.tsx` — a panel with an activity dropdown + capacity-limited support-craft
picker + live stat grid + a `support_capacity` used/limit bar + warnings, labeled **"Preview
only · does not send."** Wired into `/galaxy` behind a header toggle (`🛰 Main Ship preview`),
**separate from the send command** (single send surface preserved).

**Verify:** `scripts/verify-mainship-preview.mjs` (`npm run verify:mainship-preview`,
standalone — NOT wired into the chained verify): base stats · valid loadout (reuses adapter) ·
over-capacity → warning · unknown craft → warning · no-ship hull teaser · **wrote-nothing
proof** (no-ship player still has none) · adapter still client-denied.

**Untouched:** combat/fleet/movement/reward/send/cleanup. No deletes, no renames. Known limit:
to see *loadout* numbers a ship must exist; live players without one see the hull teaser
(commissioning = later phase). Test main-ship rows for `mspreviewtest*` users persist (not a
runtime table; tiny). **Pending build + verify (handed off to user).**

---

## 2026-06-18 — Follow-up: M4.5 browser test self-cleaning + orphan cleanup (test hygiene)

**Why** The M4.5 browser test (`m45browser.*@example.com`, no `"test"`, no cleanup step) left
runtime orphans the guarded `cleanup_test_runtime` couldn't remove (3 rows: 1 fleet + 2
build_orders). Pre-existing, predates the Phase C `%test%` convention; not a 9C change.

**Part A — prevent future:** test email `m45browser.*` → **`m45testbrowser.*@example.com`**;
`browser.yml` gains the shared `live-db-tests` **concurrency group** + an `if: always()`
cleanup step `verify-cleanup --pattern '%m45testbrowser%@example.com'`. That pattern is unique:
it can NOT match verify (`m45test.TAG` / `m*test` / `p*test` / `invtest`) or galaxy
(`galaxytest*`).

**Part B — remove existing orphans:** one-time `scripts/cleanup-m45-orphans.mjs` (+ dispatch
workflow, dry-run default). It collects runtime player_ids, **proves ownership via
`auth.admin.getUserById` (email must match `/^m45browser\./`)**, shows the rows, then deletes
child→parent **only** those players' runtime rows. No TRUNCATE; no guard change; never touches
bases/inventory/main_ship/config/world.

**Result:** dry-run proved **1** orphan player (`m45browser.1781756112790@example.com`) owning
exactly 3 rows (1 completed fleet + 2 terminal build_orders); `--confirm` deleted them
(child→parent). The renamed M4.5 browser run self-cleaned its own 3 rows via `%m45testbrowser%`.
**verify:phase8 ✅ 21/21, galaxy 9A/9B ✅, M4.5 browser ✅** — all test data self-cleans to 0.

**db:counts after = 360, and that is CORRECT (not test junk):** a read-only owner diagnostic
(`scripts/whoami-runtime.mjs` + `runtime-owners.yml`) showed all remaining runtime rows belong
to **ONE REAL player — `gkwngns714@gmail.com`** (the project owner's own manual galaxy-map test:
an expedition to a pirate hunt → 1 fleet + 1 combat encounter, 88 ticks/264 events). **Not
deleted — real player data.** Test infrastructure leftover = **0**. (The 88 ticks mean a verify
run had `combat_tick_logging` on during that combat; it's reset to false by m4/m5's finally and
those ticks age out via Phase B 3-day retention.)

**Net:** M4.5 browser test is now self-cleaning + serialized; old orphans removed; no real/
config/permanent data touched; no TRUNCATE; no gameplay change. **Follow-up CLOSED.**

---

## 2026-06-18 — Phase 9C: Expedition UI Reframe (BUILD + VERIFY + BROWSER GREEN ✅)

**Request** Make the player understand: Galaxy Map = where you send expeditions; Command
Center = status + shortcuts; fleet status area = active/returning/completed. Remove duplicate
send controls. Frontend/copy only — no backend.

**Duplicate removed:** the old in-dashboard `SendFleetPanel` (list-based send) duplicated the
Phase 9B map send → **deleted** (`src/features/fleets/SendFleetPanel.tsx`; only the Dashboard
imported it). `/galaxy` is now the **only** send surface.

**Reframe (frontend only):**
- `ExpeditionLauncher.tsx` (new) — replaces the dashboard send panel with a pointer card:
  "Send your first from the Galaxy Map", a prominent **Open Galaxy Map** button, and the
  reward rule in plain words ("pending while out · secured only on return"). Empty-vs-active
  copy. testid `dashboard-expedition-launcher`.
- `Dashboard.tsx` — swaps `SendFleetPanel` → `ExpeditionLauncher`; header already links to the
  map. No other send control remains.
- `FleetStatusPanel.tsx` — kept the `Fleets` heading + "previous run(s)" wording (m45 selectors)
  but added a subtitle ("Active expeditions — travel, on-station, and returns"), reframed the
  empty state to **"No active expedition. Send your first from the Galaxy Map →"** (links to
  `/galaxy`), and made the status badge **activity-aware** (present + hunt → "Fighting", else
  "On station"). Existing reward wording kept ("rewards locked (secured on arrival)").

**No backend touched** — no migration, no RPC/combat/reward/return/cleanup change, no second
map or send flow. Phase 9B send logic unchanged.

**Tests:** `galaxy9b.spec.ts` gains a check that the Command Center shows
`dashboard-expedition-launcher` and has **no** "Send a fleet" control (single-surface proof).
9A/9B/m45 selectors preserved.

**Result (commit `aaea9d5`):** build/typecheck + lint ✅, Pages deployed. **verify:phase8 ✅
21/21.** **Browser: 9A 1/1, 9B 1/1** (incl. single-send-surface assertion), **M4.5 1/1**
(confirms the FleetStatusPanel reframe kept its selectors). **db:counts runtime = 0.** No
backend/migration/table-write change; `/galaxy` is the only send surface. **Phase 9C CLOSED.**

---

## 2026-06-18 — Phase 9B: Map-based Expedition Send (BUILD + VERIFY + BROWSER GREEN ✅)

**Backend path inspection (done before wiring — no backend change, no migration):**
- **RPC used:** `send_fleet_to_location(p_base uuid, p_location uuid, p_units jsonb)` (migration
  0019), via the existing wrapper `sendFleetToLocation(baseId, locationId, units)` in
  `fleetApi.ts`. This is the same path Phase 8's chain (verify-m4) drives — already verified.
- **Inputs:** base id, location id, `units` = `[{unit_type_id, quantity}]`.
- **Success:** `{ fleet_id, movement_id, arrive_at }`.
- **Failure:** raises → supabase-js returns `error.message`; the wrapper throws it.
- **Backend-authoritative validation (already present):** base owned+active · location valid/
  active · `activity_type ∈ {none, hunt_pirates}` · **active-fleet-limit (max_active_fleets=3,
  counts moving/present/returning)** · units non-empty · units available & positive (via
  `base_reserve_units`, which also *reserves* them so the same units can't be re-sent) · fleet
  power ≥ `min_power_required`. → it already blocks invalid sends, over-limit/duplicate active
  expeditions, insufficient units, and invalid/locked destinations. **No second expedition
  system created.**

**Implementation (frontend only):**
- `useGalaxyMapData.ts` — additionally loads `unitTypes` (catalog, static) + `baseUnits`
  (polled) so the command area can offer a loadout. Still read-only fetches.
- `ExpeditionCommand.tsx` (new) — replaces the disabled 9A placeholder. Compact unit picker +
  Send → **confirmation step** → calls `sendFleetToLocation` **exactly once** (synchronous
  `sendingRef` guard + `sending` state → double-submit-proof). Shows sending / success / error
  states + a disabled reason. **No optimistic movement** — on success it calls the hook's
  `refresh()`; the movement line appears only from refetched `movements`.
- `GalaxyMapScreen.tsx` — wires the command area into the detail panel; passes base/units/
  unitTypes; `onSent` → refresh.
- `LocationMarker.tsx` — adds `data-activity` / `data-location-id` (test selectors). `FleetMovementLine.tsx` — adds `data-testid="galaxy-movement-line"`.
- **Frontend-only checks (clarity, not authority):** no destination / non-dispatchable
  activity / no units selected / already sending → disabled with a reason. Everything real
  (ownership, limits, units, power, validity) stays backend-authoritative; backend errors are
  surfaced verbatim.

**No direct table writes from the UI** — the only write is the approved `send_fleet_to_location`
RPC. No combat/reward/return/cleanup/logging logic touched.

**Tests:** `galaxy.spec.ts` updated (9A read-only smoke kept; send button asserted disabled
before a loadout). `galaxy9b.spec.ts` (new) — select a dispatchable marker → pick units → send
→ confirm (double-clicked) → success → assert **exactly one** fleet+movement via backend read
→ movement line on map → no dup from double-submit → send disabled before units → no console
errors. `browser-galaxy.yml` runs both then `verify:cleanup` (test email contains `test` so
`cleanup_test_runtime` removes its runtime rows → db:counts back to 0).

**Result (commit `aefd5ea`):** build/typecheck ✅ (lint clean after remount-via-key + CSS
cursor fixes), Pages deployed. **verify:phase8 ✅ 21/21 … M4 40/40** (run alone). **Browser:
9A smoke 1/1, 9B send 1/1.** **db:counts runtime = 0** (galaxy cleanup scoped to
`%galaxytest%`). **Transient verify failure root-caused + fixed:** I'd dispatched the browser
suite + verify concurrently; the browser workflow's broad `%test%` cleanup deleted verify's
in-flight phase5 fleet mid-combat → "no wave cleared". Fixed: shared `live-db-tests`
concurrency group on both workflows + galaxy cleanup narrowed to `%galaxytest%` (can't touch
verify's m*/p* users). Re-run verify alone = 21/21. **No backend/migration/table-write/second-
expedition-system added.** **Phase 9B CLOSED.**

---

## 2026-06-18 — Phase 9A: Read-only Visual Galaxy Map (BUILD + VERIFY GREEN ✅)

**Request** First visual galaxy map screen — read-only, using existing backend world data.
See the world/locations/home/ship/active movements; select a location for details. No
commands, no writes, no backend change.

**No backend change needed.** All data already exists: `get_world_map()` (sectors→zones→
locations with x,y), `bases` (x,y,name), `fleet_movements` (**origin_x/y + target_x/y** stored
→ paths drawable directly), `location_state` (pressure/danger), `main_ship_instances`
(owner-read). Confirmed before building; **no migration added**.

**Files (all `src/features/map/`, matching the existing feature structure):**
- `useGalaxyMapData.ts` — read-only hook: world map + base once; polls movements + location
  states + a small `main_ship_instances` owner-read every 4s. Builds location→sector/zone meta.
- `GalaxyMap.tsx` — plain **SVG** 2D map (no canvas/WebGL). Normalizes world coords into a
  0..1000 viewBox; transform group gives pan (drag) + zoom (wheel/+/−/reset). Renders movement
  paths, home/ship anchor, and location markers. Labels hidden when zoomed out.
- `LocationMarker.tsx` — colored marker + truncated label, counter-scaled to stay constant
  on-screen size; selecting only highlights.
- `FleetMovementLine.tsx` — dashed origin→target path (amber outbound / sky return) + ETA
  (`formatCountdown`). Purely visual.
- `GalaxyMapScreen.tsx` — page with loading / error / empty / selection states + a **read-only
  detail panel** (name, sector/zone, type, coords, status, difficulty/reward, live world
  state) + a disabled “Send expedition (Phase 9B)” button + “coming in Phase 9B” note.
- `fleetTypes.ts` — additive: `origin_x/y`, `target_x/y` (already returned by `select('*')`).
- `App.tsx` — new `/galaxy` route (RequireAuth). Nav links added from Dashboard + MapPage.

**Read-only guarantees:** the screen calls only read paths (`get_world_map`, table selects on
`location_state`/`fleets`/`fleet_movements`/`main_ship_instances`). No RPC mutation, no
`send_fleet`, no table writes. Action-implying controls are disabled/labeled Phase 9B.

**Result (commit `c1de252`):** frontend **build/typecheck ✅** (`tsc -b && vite build`), **Pages
deployed** (`/galaxy` live), **verify:phase8 ✅** (Phase 8 21/21 … M4 40/40; frontend can't
affect backend). db:counts unaffected (auto-cleanup ran). Manual interactive browser check
not runnable from the dev sandbox (no GUI/network) — offered a Playwright smoke test as
follow-up. **Phase 9A code complete + CI-green.** Phase 9B: click-to-select destination +
expedition send.

**Follow-up — Playwright /galaxy smoke (commit `6d84d19`):** `tests/galaxy.spec.ts` signs in,
opens `/galaxy`, asserts the map + ≥1 marker render, selecting a marker opens the read-only
detail panel, the Send button is **disabled + Phase-9B**, and **no fleet/movement is created**
(read-only proof), failing on serious console/page errors. Stable testids added
(`galaxy-map-screen/-loading/-error`, `galaxy-location-marker`, `galaxy-location-detail-panel`,
`galaxy-send-expedition-disabled`). `verify:galaxy:browser` script + `browser-galaxy.yml`
dispatch. **Result: smoke 1/1 ✅, build ✅, verify:phase8 ✅ (21/21 … M4 40/40), db:counts
runtime = 0.** No backend/migration/write change.

---

## 2026-06-18 — Prevention Phase C: self-cleaning verify runs (DEPLOYED + VERIFIED ✅)

**Request** Stop verify runs leaving runtime/test rows behind. Minimal + safe; no gameplay/
combat/reward/movement/report changes; no TRUNCATE; no real/config/permanent data touched.

**How test data is identified (no `test_run_id` added):** every verify script signs up
throwaway users with emails matching `%test%@example.com` (m4test/m5test/m45test/invtest/
p4test…p8test), and every runtime table carries `player_id`. So verify-created runtime rows =
rows owned by a test-email player. The email pattern is the cleanup key — the existing
convention made a schema column unnecessary.

**Migration `0048_cleanup_test_runtime.sql`:** `cleanup_test_runtime(p_pattern default
'%test%@example.com', p_dry_run default true)` → returns `(table_name, rows_matched,
rows_deleted, cleanup_key)`. Deletes ONLY the 9 runtime tables (+ fleet_units) for test-email
players, child→parent. Guards: pattern MUST contain `test` (else raises); **never** touches
`auth.users`, `bases`, `base_units`, `base_resources`, `player_inventory`, `inventory_ledger`,
`main_ship_instances`, `*_types`, `game_config`, or world tables. No TRUNCATE. SECURITY
DEFINER, service_role only.

**Files:** migration 0048; `scripts/verify-cleanup.mjs` (`verify:cleanup:dry-run` /
`verify:cleanup --confirm`, optional `--pattern`); `package.json`; `verify-phase8.mjs` prints
a cleanup reminder at the end; `verify.yml` adds a final `if: always()` **auto-cleanup step**
so every CI verify removes its own test data (even on failure).

**Result (commit `2ac700f`):** migration 0048 deployed ✅. verify:phase8 ✅ (Phase 8 21/21 …
M4 40/40). Auto-cleanup deleted **728 runtime rows** (matched == deleted every table — the
whole accumulated test backlog + this run). `db:counts` after: **all 10 runtime tables = 0**.
No TRUNCATE; no auth.users/bases/inventory/main_ship/config/world touched. **Phase C CLOSED —
prevention complete (A logging controls · B retention cleanup · C self-cleaning verify).**

---

## 2026-06-18 — Prevention Phase B: safe retention cleanup (DEPLOYED + VERIFIED ✅)

**Request** Add a batched, dry-run-first retention cleanup. No TRUNCATE, no destructive
reset, no active/seeded/player-owned data touched.

**Schema reconciliation (inspected, not assumed) — reported deviations:**
- `combat_ticks` has **`resolved_at`**, not `created_at` → index + rule use `resolved_at`.
- `fleet_movements` has **no `updated_at`** → index + rule use `resolved_at` (set on resolve).
- `reward_grants` has **`granted_at`**, not `claimed_at` → use `granted_at`. (There is no
  "pending"/"claimed" state in this table — a grant row IS an already-secured deposit; pending
  rewards live on `combat_encounters`/`fleet_movements` jsonb and are untouched.)

**Cascade hazard (inspected):** ON DELETE CASCADE roots everything at `fleets`
(→ fleet_units, fleet_movements, location_presence, combat_encounters → ticks/events/reports;
presence → encounters too). Since `combat_reports` (30d) hangs under encounters/presence/
fleets, deleting any ancestor would cascade-delete a still-retained report. So **encounters,
location_presence, and fleets are additionally gated**: never deleted while they have an
ACTIVE encounter or a RETAINED (<30d) report. Net: those three are effectively kept until
their report expires; non-combat presence (no report) still cleans at 1 day.

**Migration `0047_runtime_retention_cleanup.sql`:**
- 10 indexes (`CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`) on the real scan columns (3 substituted per above).
- `maintenance_cleanup_runtime_data(dry_run boolean default true, batch_limit int default 5000)`
  → returns `(table_name, retention_rule, rows_matched, rows_deleted, dry_run)` per table.
  Batched deletes via `ctid in (… limit batch_limit)` loops — never one-shot, never TRUNCATE.
  Kill-switch: if `runtime_cleanup_enabled=false`, forced to dry-run. SECURITY DEFINER,
  service_role only.
- Retention: ticks 3d, events 7d, reports 30d, encounters terminal>14d(+guard), presence
  terminal>1d(+guard), movements terminal>14d, fleet_units (parent terminal>14d), fleets
  terminal>14d(+guard), reward_grants 30d, build_orders terminal>30d.
- Safety: only TERMINAL statuses deleted (active/retreating/moving/waiting/queued never
  match); active encounters/fleets/movements/rewards/builds never deleted; no bases/
  base_resources/base_units/inventory/main_ship/_types/game_config/world tables referenced.

**Files:** migration 0047; `scripts/db-cleanup.mjs` (`db:cleanup:dry-run` / `db:cleanup
--confirm`); `package.json`; `.github/workflows/db-cleanup.yml` (dispatch; dry-run default,
deletes only on confirm=true; shows size/counts before+after).

**Fix during deploy:** first push failed 42P13 — input param `dry_run` collided with the OUT
column `dry_run`; renamed inputs to `p_dry_run`/`p_batch_limit` (project `p_`-convention),
OUT column stays `dry_run`. **Result (commit `dac35a1`):** migration 0047 deployed ✅.
**Dry-run: 0 matched across all 10 tables** (all data fresh — nothing past the 3/7/14/30-day
cutoffs); **live run (confirm=true): 0 matched / 0 deleted** — delete path executes cleanly,
nothing destructive. **verify:phase8 ✅ — Phase 8 21/21 … M4 40/40** (indexes + function did
not affect combat/regression). **Phase B CLOSED.** Next: Phase C (self-cleaning verify runs).

## 2026-06-18 — Prevention Phase A: combat logging controls + DB visibility (DEPLOYED + VERIFIED ✅)

**Request** Stop byeharu re-filling the disk: make high-volume combat logging opt-in and add
size/row visibility. No deletes (that's Phase B), no combat-outcome changes.

**Migration `0046_combat_logging_controls.sql`:**
- `cfg_bool(key)` accessor + `set_game_config(key, value jsonb)` (service_role/CI only).
- 7 `game_config` flags (insert-if-absent): `combat_debug_logging=false`,
  `combat_tick_logging=false`, `combat_event_logging=true`, `runtime_cleanup_enabled=true`,
  `combat_tick_retention_days=3`, `combat_event_retention_days=7`, `combat_report_retention_days=30`.
- `process_combat_ticks` (same combat math) now **gates logging**: all `combat_ticks` inserts
  behind `combat_tick_logging` (default OFF → no per-tick rows); per-unit `hull_damage` events
  behind `combat_debug_logging` (default OFF → kills the worst per-tick multiplier); other
  meaningful events behind `combat_event_logging` (default ON → UI animation + reports intact).
  `v_seq` still advances so display ordering is unchanged.
- `db_table_sizes()` (top-20 by `pg_total_relation_size`) + `db_runtime_counts()` (10 runtime
  tables) — service_role only.

**Default logging after this change:** per combat tick we now write **0** `combat_ticks` rows
and **0** `hull_damage` events (was 1 tick + N hull_damage); only milestone/animation events
(wave_spawned, missile_salvo, laser_burst, unit_destroyed, explosion, retreat) remain.
`combat_reports` (player-facing summary) untouched.

**Regression compatibility:** verify-m4 + verify-m5 inspect `combat_ticks`, so they flip
`combat_tick_logging` on via `set_game_config` at start and **restore it off in finally**
(shared DB → production default stays off). Only those two scripts read ticks.

**Visibility:** `scripts/db-size.mjs` (`npm run db:size`) + `scripts/db-counts.mjs`
(`npm run db:counts`), plus a `db-report.yml` dispatch workflow to run both in CI.

**Restrictions honored:** no TRUNCATE, no deletes, no seeded/config/world/player tables
touched.

**Result (commit `e3d0ba4`):** migration 0046 deployed ✅. `db:size` + `db:counts` work
(post-cleanup DB tiny — largest table 120 kB; 240 total runtime rows). **verify:phase8 ✅ —
Phase 8 21/21, Phase 7 18/18, Phase 6 10/10, Phase 5 25/25, Phase 4 16/16, Inventory 18/18,
M4.5 27/27, M5 28/28, M4 40/40** (incl. "waves last 3+ ticks" — m4/m5 tick-toggle works).
**Phase A CLOSED.** Next: Phase B (retention cleanup function, dry-run first).

---

## 2026-06-18 — Phase 8: calculate_expedition_stats() (DEPLOYED + VERIFIED ✅)

**Request** Build the deterministic stat ADAPTER that will eventually turn Main Ship +
Support Craft (+ later Captains + Modules) + Activity into final expedition stats — the
bridge between the new main-ship model and the proven engine. **Read/compute only**; no
mutation; engine unchanged; live combat still uses the old fleet-stack path.

**Migration `0044_calculate_expedition_stats.sql`** — one function,
`calculate_expedition_stats(p_player, p_main_ship_id, p_loadout jsonb, p_activity_type)`
returns jsonb. SECURITY DEFINER, **STABLE (read-only)**, **service_role only**:
- Reads the owned `main_ship_instances` row (+ `main_ship_hull_types` for base_speed); errors
  if the ship isn't found/owned. Validates `activity_type ∈ {pirate_hunt, trade_run,
  exploration, mining, none}`.
- Normalizes the support loadout: **combines duplicate** craft ids; **rejects** unknown
  types, and non-positive / non-integer / NaN / Inf quantities.
- **Enforces `support_capacity` as a HARD cap** — `used = Σ(qty × capacity_cost)`; over the
  ship limit → rejected. This is the anti-unlimited-stacking mechanism (never a plain sum).
- Effects (conservative, linear within the cap) derive from each craft's Phase-6
  `base_stats_json` (attack→combat_power, defense→survival, repair, cargo, scan→scouting,
  mining→mining_yield, evasion→retreat_safety) plus role rules for `pirate_attention`
  (combat_damage/cargo +2, heavy_cargo +4) and a speed penalty (combat_damage 0.05,
  heavy_cargo 0.08, extraction 0.02). Non-useful-for-activity craft add a non-fatal warning.
- Returns normalized, **clamped (≥0), rounded** stats: support_capacity_used/limit, speed,
  cargo_capacity, combat_power, survival, retreat_safety, scouting, mining_yield, repair,
  pirate_attention, warnings[] — **never NaN, never negative, deterministic**.

**Read/compute only (verified):** mutates nothing — ship row + inventory unchanged after many
calls; no fleets/combat/rewards/ranking/reports touched. **NOT wired into live combat** — the
fleet-stack path still owns outcomes (M2–M5 untouched). Support-craft OWNERSHIP isn't
implemented yet, so Phase 8 validates **type/capacity/math** against `support_craft_types`
only; ownership consumption comes when loadouts attach to real expeditions.

**Anti-cheat:** new function default-grants to PUBLIC on create → re-ran the lockdown
(revoke; re-grant the 8 client RPCs; `calculate_expedition_stats` → service_role only). A
client preview RPC (auth.uid()-scoped) will arrive with the Phase 9 UI.

**Boundaries/docs:** SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES decision #8 (table-less read/compute adapter, mutates
nothing). ROADMAP Phase 8 ✅. ARCHITECTURE Phase 8 note. ACTIVITIES: documented which stats
each activity will read from the adapter later.

**Verify:** `scripts/verify-phase8.mjs` — base stats on empty loadout (0/10, speed 1, cargo
50); mixed loadout capacity (7/10); reject over-capacity / unknown / zero / negative /
non-integer; duplicate-combine; per-craft effects (missile_boat→combat+attention/speed,
cargo_drone→cargo+attention, survey→scouting, mining→yield, decoy→retreat, repair→repair+
survival); no-NaN; determinism; ship + inventory not mutated; client-denied; then chains
`verify-phase7` (full regression). CI runs `verify:phase8`.

**Status (commit `5a4c954`):** Migration 0044 **deployed ✅** (direct-Postgres push succeeded).
**Verification BLOCKED by a Supabase infra issue, not code:** every REST/RPC request returns
`upstream request timeout` — including a trivial read of the public `main_ship_hull_types`
table (which touches no Phase 8 code), persisting 13+ min across two runs. The REST/PostgREST
layer is globally unresponsive (DB accepts direct connections — deploy worked — but the API
gateway times out). Needs the Supabase project checked/restarted (paused / compute-exhausted /
stuck schema reload), then re-run `verify:phase8`.

**Resolution:** free-tier disk was full (combat-log churn from dozens of verify runs).
Cleared via one-time migration `0045_dev_cleanup_churn` (TRUNCATE of 10 throwaway runtime/log
tables over the working direct-Postgres connection — user-authorized), then a dashboard
**project restart** bounced the stuck PostgREST. **Verify ✅ — Phase 8 21/21, Phase 7 18/18,
Phase 6 10/10, Phase 5 25/25, Phase 4 16/16, Inventory 18/18, M4.5 27/27, M5 28/28, M4 40/40.
Phase 8 CLOSED.** Follow-up: Phases A–C add logging controls + safe retention cleanup + self-
cleaning verify so the disk can't fill again.

---

## 2026-06-18 — Phase 7: Main Ship Instance (DEPLOYED + VERIFIED ✅)

**Request** Create the player's ONE main ship — the player identity, not stackable, one
active per player. Additive foundation only: no combat hook, no support-craft attachment, no
`calculate_expedition_stats`, no capacity enforcement. Engine untouched.

**Migration `0043_main_ship_instance.sql`** — two tables + three server-only functions:
- `main_ship_hull_types` (Reference/Config, public-read): one starter hull `starter_frigate`
  — base_hp 500, base_speed 1.0, cargo 50, **support_capacity 10**, captain_slots 2,
  module_slots 3. (Conservative; not final balance.)
- `main_ship_instances` (Main Ship system, owner-read, **no client write**): `player_id`
  UNIQUE (one per player), hull FK, name default 'Byeharu', `status` CHECK in the 10 allowed
  states (default `home`), hp/max_hp/cargo_used/cargo_capacity/support_capacity/captain_slots/
  module_slots with `>=0`/`>0` checks. Stats are copied from the hull on creation so the
  instance can later diverge (damage/upgrades) without mutating the template.
- `ensure_main_ship_for_player(player)` — idempotent, concurrency-safe via the `player_id`
  UNIQUE (`on conflict do nothing` → select) → one ship per player. `get_main_ship(player)`
  read helper. `rename_main_ship(player,name)` — trims, rejects empty + >40 chars, requires an
  existing ship. All SECURITY DEFINER, **service_role only** (clients read their ship via
  owner-read RLS; no client mutation/RPC path).

**What did NOT change (by design):** combat, fleets, `fleet_movements`, presence, production/
build queue, rewards, inventory, support_craft metadata. No fleet-table renames. Player-
creation path (`initialize_new_player`) untouched — the ship is created on demand via
`ensure_main_ship_for_player` (a future bootstrap/RPC will call it). Anti-cheat: new functions
default-grant to PUBLIC → re-ran the lockdown (revoke; re-grant the 8 client RPCs; ensure/get/
rename → service_role). Prior service_role grants untouched.

**Boundaries/docs:** `main_ship_hull_types` added to Reference/Config; new **Main Ship** owner
row (sole writer of `main_ship_instances`) + per-system contract + ownership decision #7.
ROADMAP Phase 7 ✅. ARCHITECTURE Phase 7 note (ship exists, doesn't drive expeditions yet).

**Verify:** `scripts/verify-phase7.mjs` — starter hull public-read + client-write-blocked;
ensure creates exactly one ship (idempotent, no dup); owner-read + cross-user RLS; client
INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE + server-RPCs all blocked; stats valid & copied from hull; status
defaults `home`; rename trims + rejects empty/overlong/no-ship; then chains `verify-phase6`
(full regression) to prove the engine is unchanged. CI runs `verify:phase7`.

**Result (commit `05b1cc5`):** Deploy ✅ · Build ✅ · Pages ✅ · Verify ✅ —
**Phase 7 18/18, Phase 6 10/10, Phase 5 25/25, Phase 4 16/16, Inventory 18/18, M4.5 27/27,
M5 28/28, M4 40/40** (M2 11 / M3 13 chained), 0 failed. Ship created hp 500/500, support 10,
captain 2, module 3, status `home`; idempotent; client writes + server RPCs blocked. Migration
0043 live on `dlkbwztrdvnnjlvaydut`. **Phase 7 CLOSED.**

---

## 2026-06-18 — Phase 6: Support Craft Reframe (DEPLOYED + VERIFIED ✅)

**Request** Reframe "build ships" toward the future "build support craft / expedition
equipment" model — **metadata foundation only**, no engine change. Support craft must be
**capacity-limited loadout choices, not unlimited additive power**. No instances, no
expedition attachment, no `calculate_expedition_stats`, no capacity enforcement yet.

**Migration `0042_support_craft_types.sql`** — one Reference/Config table (mirrors
`item_types`): `support_craft_type_id` PK, name, role, `capacity_cost int check (>0)`,
stackable, buildable, `activity_tags jsonb`, `tradeoffs_json`, `base_stats_json`. Public-read
RLS, **no write policy / no write grant → clients cannot mutate**. Seeds the **8 starter
craft** with real roles + capacity costs + tradeoffs:
- scout_escort (light_escort, cap 1) · missile_boat (combat_damage, cap 3) · repair_drone
  (repair, cap 2) · cargo_drone (cargo, cap 2) · survey_drone (scanning, cap 2) · decoy_drone
  (retreat_safety, cap 1) · mining_drone (extraction, cap 2) · trade_barge (heavy_cargo, cap 5).
- `base_stats_json` is illustrative only — **nothing consumes it yet** (Phase 8).

**What did NOT change (by design):** combat (`unit_types` scout/corvette/frigate untouched,
separate namespace), the serial build queue / `build_orders` / `train_units`, fleets,
movement, rewards, inventory. No fleet-table renames. No new functions (so no execute-lockdown
needed). Frontend wording left as-is to avoid risking the M4.5 browser acceptance; the
build-queue reframe is conceptual/documented (M4.5 = Serial Build Queue Foundation; ARCHITECTURE
+ SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES updated).

**Boundaries/docs:** `support_craft_types` added to the Reference/Config sole-writer row;
new ownership decision #6 (metadata only, capacity enforced later by main ship +
`calculate_expedition_stats`). ROADMAP Phase 6 ✅. ARCHITECTURE Phase 6 note.

**Verify:** `scripts/verify-phase6.mjs` — 8 definitions exist & public-read; capacity_cost > 0
matching documented costs; every craft has role + activity_tags + tradeoffs; zero overlap with
combat `unit_types` (engine untouched); client INSERT/UPDATE blocked by RLS; then chains
`verify-phase5` (→ phase4 → inventory → m45 → m5 → m2/m3/m4) to prove combat + serial queue
unchanged. CI runs `verify:phase6`.

**Result (commit `4038209`):** Deploy ✅ · Build ✅ · Pages ✅ · Verify ✅ —
**Phase 6 10/10, Phase 5 25/25, Phase 4 16/16, Inventory 18/18, M4.5 27/27, M5 28/28,
M4 40/40** (M2 11 / M3 13 chained), 0 failed. 8 craft seeded, capacity 1–5, client writes
blocked, zero overlap with combat unit_types. Migration 0042 live on `dlkbwztrdvnnjlvaydut`.
**Phase 6 CLOSED.**

---

## 2026-06-18 — Phase 5: Multi-Item Pirate Loot (DEPLOYED + VERIFIED ✅)

**Request** Pirate combat should accrue real item drops alongside metal — a controlled
combat-reward DATA change, not an engine rewrite. Reuse the proven Phase 4 bundle; keep the
reward timing law; metal stays in `base_resources`; server-authoritative loot only. No
crafting/modules/captains/UI.

**Migration `0041_pirate_loot.sql`** — two isolated, server-only helpers + a 3-line injection
into the existing combat tick:
- `pirate_loot_for_wave(p_wave int, p_danger numeric)` — the loot table. **Deterministic**
  (no RNG → stable tests), small/clamped, **only Phase-3-seeded ids**: scrap (every wave),
  pirate_alloy (≥3), weapon_parts (≥5), engine_parts (≥8), repair_parts (≥10). `p_danger`
  reserved for future scaling; v1 keeps qty=1 so survival can't make loot explode. Returns
  `[]` below wave 1 (no NaN, no unknown ids).
- `loot_merge_items(a, b)` — combines two items[] by id (summed) to keep the accumulated
  bundle tidy across waves. (reward_grant also de-dups on deposit — belt & suspenders.)
- `process_combat_ticks` (copied verbatim from 0030) gains exactly three PHASE-5 lines:
  declare `v_loot_items`; on wave-clear set `v_loot_items := pirate_loot_for_wave(wave,danger)`
  and put it in `reward_delta`; merge `items[]` into `total_rewards_json` next to the
  accumulated metal. Everything else — carry-home, retreat, defeat-forfeit (`'{}'`),
  secured-on-arrival — is unchanged.

**Reward flow (all unchanged from Phase 4):** drops are pending in `total_rewards_json` →
ride `reward_payload_json` home → `reward_grant` on arrival splits metal→`base_resources`,
items→`player_inventory` (idempotent). Defeat clears the bundle → forfeits metal AND items.
Retreat alone never secures.

**Boundaries/docs:** `ACTIVITIES.md` pirate_hunt loot section made concrete (server-side
only; rare progression ids reserved). Combat still owns only its reward accrual — it writes
the pending bundle, never Inventory/Base directly. Frontend unchanged (no client loot path).

**Anti-cheat:** new helpers default-grant to PUBLIC on create → 0041 re-runs the lockdown
(revoke from public/anon/authenticated, re-grant the 8 client RPCs; loot helpers → service_role
for CI only). reward_grant/inventory_* service_role grants untouched.

**Verify:** `scripts/verify-phase5.mjs` — (A) deterministic loot-table + merge helpers
(positive ints, known ids, clamped, dedup), (B) **real combat**: items appear in
`total_rewards_json`, stay pending through retreat, deposit to `player_inventory` +
`base_resources` on home arrival, report keeps metal; (C) **defeat** forfeits metal+items;
(D) chains `verify-phase4` (→ inventory → m45 → m5 → m2/m3/m4). CI runs `verify:phase5`.

**Result (commit `bf32dbf`):** Deploy ✅ · Build ✅ · Pages ✅ · Verify ✅ —
**Phase 5 25/25, Phase 4 16/16, Inventory 18/18, M4.5 27/27, M5 28/28, M4 40/40** (M2 11 /
M3 13 chained), 0 failed. Real run banked metal +38 and scrap +1 on arrival; defeat forfeited
the bundle. Migration 0041 live on `dlkbwztrdvnnjlvaydut`. **Phase 5 CLOSED.**

---

## 2026-06-17 — Phase 4: Pending Loot Bundle (DEPLOYED + VERIFIED ✅)

**Request** Generalize the metal-only pending reward into a future-proof
`PendingRewardBundle { metal?, items:[{item_id,quantity}] }`. Backend plumbing only — no
new pirate drops, no trading/mining/crafting/UI. Keep the reward timing law exactly:
pending while travelling · secured **once on home arrival** · forfeited on defeat · retreat
doesn't secure. Metal stays in `base_resources`; items go to `player_inventory`.

**Key finding (no schema change needed).** The pending bundle already rides existing jsonb
columns end-to-end: combat accrues → `combat_encounters.total_rewards_json` → (on exit)
`fleet_movements.reward_payload_json` (via `movement_attach_cargo`) → (on arrival)
`reward_grant('combat', encounter, player, base, bundle)`. So Phase 4 is a **single
function change** — additive, no new column, no rename.

**Migration `0040_pending_loot_bundle.sql`** — rewrites `reward_grant()` (the secured-
deposit owner) to **split the bundle**:
- metal (and any scalar resource) → `Base.base_add_resources(p_rewards - 'items')`. The
  `- 'items'` strip is essential: `base_add_resources` casts every jsonb value to double and
  would choke on the items array.
- items[] → `Inventory.inventory_deposit(player, item, qty, key)` with key
  `'<source_type>:<source_id>:<item_id>'`.
- **Idempotency:** metal guarded by `reward_grants` UNIQUE(source_type,source_id) (one
  grant/source, early-return on replay) **plus** the inventory ledger key — both metal and
  items double-deposit-proof across cron retry / reprocessing.
- **Fail-safe validation:** items deduped by id (quantities summed), filtered to positive
  integers `< 1e9` (rejects negative/zero/NaN/Infinity); unknown item ids skipped with a
  logged `WARNING`; per-item + outer exception isolation so one bad entry never forfeits the
  metal or the valid items.
- Anti-cheat: `create or replace` preserves the 0039 client-revoke; added
  `grant execute … reward_grant … to service_role` (server/CI only, never clients) so the
  verifier can drive it — mirrors `inventory_deposit` / `process_build_queue`.

**Boundaries:** `SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` — Reward now splits the bundle (sole caller of
`base_add_resources`; calls `Inventory.inventory_deposit` for items). Call graph stays
acyclic (Reward → Base, Reward → Inventory). Combat/movement unchanged; combat still accrues
**metal only** (no new drops — that's Phase 5). Reports keep `total_rewards_json` (metal
display intact; items ride along for free, display deferred).

**Verify:** `scripts/verify-phase4.mjs` — drives `reward_grant` directly as service_role
(metal-only · metal+items · idempotent re-grant · per-source key · unknown-item-safe ·
duplicate-combine · negative/zero/NaN-skip · empty-bundle no-op · client-denied) then chains
the regression (`verify-inventory` → m45 → m5 → m2/m3/m4) which proves the end-to-end timing
law (defeat forfeits, retreat doesn't secure, reports keep metal). CI `verify.yml` now runs
`verify:phase4`.

**Result (commit `4e1d7eb`):** Deploy ✅ · Build ✅ · Pages ✅ · Verify ✅ —
**Phase 4 16/16, Inventory 18/18, M4.5 27/27, M5 28/28, M4 40/40** (M2 11 / M3 13 chained),
0 failed. Migration 0040 live on `dlkbwztrdvnnjlvaydut`. **Phase 4 CLOSED.**

---

## 2026-06-17 — Phase 3: generic inventory foundation (DEPLOYED + VERIFIED ✅)

**Request** Clean generic item inventory for future rewards/materials. Metal stays in
`base_resources` (untouched); a future loot bundle deposits metal → base_resources, items →
player_inventory. No trading/mining/crafting/etc.

**Migration `0039_inventory.sql`:**
- `item_types` (Reference/Config, public read) + 10 starter items (scrap, ore, crystal,
  pirate_alloy, weapon_parts, engine_parts, repair_parts, captain_memory_shard,
  blueprint_fragment, artifact_core).
- `player_inventory` (PK `(player_id,item_id)`, `quantity >= 0`) — **owner-read RLS, no client
  write**. `inventory_ledger` (audit + `unique(idempotency_key)`) — owner-read.
- Functions (SECURITY DEFINER, server-only): `inventory_deposit(player,item,qty,key?)`
  (validates item+qty, upserts, **idempotent via the ledger key**), `inventory_spend`
  (transactional `FOR UPDATE`, rejects insufficient, **never negative**),
  `inventory_get_balance`. Lockdown re-grant (clients unchanged; inventory_* → service_role).

**Boundaries:** new **Inventory** system owns `player_inventory`+`inventory_ledger`;
`item_types` = Reference/Config. Metal/`base_resources` **untouched**; combat/movement/
world-state/reward unchanged.

**Verify:** `scripts/verify-inventory.mjs` (11 tests: seed, owner-read, cross-user RLS,
client-cannot-mutate, deposit-adds, idempotent deposit, spend-subtracts, insufficient,
no-negative, unknown-item, regression). CI `verify.yml` now runs `verify:inventory` (chains
M4.5 → M5 → M2/M3/M4).

**Result (commit `49cc946`):** Deploy ✅ · Build ✅ · Pages ✅ · Verify ✅ —
**Inventory 18/18, M4.5 27/27, M5 28/28, M4 40/40** (M2/M3 chained green), 0 failed.
Migration 0039 live on `dlkbwztrdvnnjlvaydut`. **Phase 3 CLOSED.**

---

## 2026-06-17 — Phase 2: Expedition Activity Architecture (design doc only)

**Request** Define the clean activity abstraction so future gameplay types plug into the
Expedition Engine without spaghetti. Docs only — no code, no migrations, no `src/`.

**Work:** new **`docs/ACTIVITIES.md`** covering the 10 required items —
`ExpeditionActivityType` (pirate_hunt / trade_run / exploration / mining, mapped to the
existing `activity_type` enum placeholders); shared lifecycle owned by the Engine (travel ·
arrival · presence · dispatch · pending-reward accrual · return · secured-on-arrival deposit ·
status · reports); per-activity ownership table; the **Activity Handler contract**
(`<activity>_create` + `process_<activity>_ticks` cron + optional `_request_leave` +
Engine.finish) — grounded in the existing `activity_start` router + the Combat precedent;
`PendingRewardBundle` (`{ metal?, items[] }`); history-only report/result shape; "add an
activity = enum value + handler + one dispatch line + one panel" (no giant switch); the
anti-spaghetti call graph (`activity → pending → secure-on-return → inventory → progression →
ranking`); explicit non-goals; acceptance criteria.

**No code / migrations / `src/` changes.** ROADMAP Phase 2 marked done → ACTIVITIES.md.
M2 11/11 · M3 13/13 · M4 40/40 · M4.5 27/27 unaffected (nothing executable changed). **Next:**
Phase 3 (generic inventory) when chosen.

---

## 2026-06-17 — Phase 1: roadmap / architecture reconciliation (docs only)

**Request** After M4.5, make the docs match the real game direction — **main-ship expedition
game**. Documentation only; no gameplay code; M2/M3/M4/M4.5 stay green.

**Work (docs only):**
- **New `docs/ROADMAP.md`** — the authoritative forward direction: final identity (one main
  ship + captains + modules + support craft → expedition → activity → return → inventory →
  progression → ranking); reclassification (**M2–M4 = Expedition Engine**, **M4.5 = Serial
  Build Queue Foundation**); standing laws (support craft = capacity-limited loadout, not
  additive power; one-directional pipeline *activity → pending → secure-on-return → inventory →
  progression → ranking*; don't replace the engine, replace the source of expedition stats via
  `calculate_expedition_stats`); the Phase 1–20 plan.
- **README** — intro reframed to main-ship expedition; milestones reclassified (Engine +
  Build Queue Foundation done) + forward direction → ROADMAP; removed the stale "M7 not
  started" / combat-reward-only framing.
- **ARCHITECTURE §16** — direction-update note + reclassification + pointer to ROADMAP.

**Not built (deferred to later phases):** main ship · captains · modules · inventory · trading
· exploration · mining · ranking. No migrations, no frontend behavior change. M2 11/11 · M3
13/13 · M4 40/40 · M4.5 27/27 unaffected. **Next:** Phase 2 (expedition activity architecture,
design only) when chosen.

## 2026-06-17 — ✅ M4.5 CLOSED (browser acceptance passed)

The automated **Playwright browser acceptance** test passed against the live Pages site —
M4.5's manual gate is met, so M4.5 is **closed**.

- **Browser test:** `tests/m45.spec.ts` (`verify:m45:browser`), CI workflow
  `.github/workflows/browser.yml`, run against `https://gkwngns714-spec.github.io/byeharu/`.
  **1 passed (17.3s).** Verified live: friendly coords (Sector 0:0, no raw "0, 0") · Train
  Scout ×5 active row (Per ship / Total order / Ship 1 of 5 / Remaining ticking / "delivered
  when full order completes") · Corvette ×2 waiting (no countdown, no Ship N) · cancel inline
  confirm (Refund + Penalty + Keep Building + Confirm Cancel) · Keep Building doesn't cancel ·
  Confirm refunds **once** (+125 = 50%) and the next waiting starts · refresh = no duplicate
  refund, cancelled gone · completed-history fold/unfold. Screenshots + traces uploaded as the
  `playwright-m45` CI artifact.
- **Backend:** `verify:m45` **27/27**; regression **M2 11/11 · M3 13/13 · M4 40/40**; CI build
  green. No gameplay/migration changes for the test (test infra only).

M4.5 reframed for the future as the **Serial Build Queue Foundation** (see
[[byeharu-final-direction]] — Main Ship + Support Craft). **Next:** Phase 1 docs/roadmap
reconciliation (docs only).

---

## 2026-06-17 — M4.5 Core UX + production queue law fix (CLOSED — see entry above)

**Status: NOT closed.** Fixes to the **M7 production queue** + two UI bugs (`build_orders`
is the M7 system — M5/M6/M7 already done; full M2–M7 kept green). Migration `0038`.

**Production now SERIAL** (was accidentally parallel — every order got `complete_at` on
creation): `build_orders` gains `waiting`/`active` states, nullable `complete_at`,
`started_at`; config `max_active_ship_production_slots=1` (designed to become N).
`train_units` enqueues **waiting** then `production_start_next` promotes one to **active**
(absolute `started_at` + `complete_at`). `process_build_queue` completes due **active**
orders then starts the next. Waiting items have **no `complete_at`** and don't tick.

**Cancellation:** `cancel_build_order` RPC — server-authoritative; validates ownership +
status; **waiting → 100% refund, active → 50%, completed/cancelled → rejected** (refund via
`Base.base_add_resources`). Cancelling the active item starts the next waiting one.

**UI:** `BuildQueuePanel` shows active (countdown) vs waiting (no countdown) + Cancel
buttons; `FleetStatusPanel` completed-history fold fixed (was an empty `<details>`) →
controlled toggle "Show N previous run(s)" / "Hide previous run(s)" with real content;
new `src/lib/location.ts` `formatLocationLabel` + `BasePanel` replace raw "0, 0" with
"Sector 0:0" / friendly names.

**Boundaries:** Production-only; combat/movement/world-state/reward untouched; absolute
timestamps (no per-tick decrement). `SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES` Production row already covers it.

**Verify:** `scripts/verify-m45.mjs` (serial · completion-starts-next · cancel waiting/active
· cannot-cancel-completed · ownership · anti-cheat · regression) — **supersedes `verify-m7`**
(parallel model; removed). CI `verify.yml` now runs `verify:m45`.

**Closure gate (pending):** deploy `0038` · `verify:m45` green · M2–M5 regression · CI build ·
browser check (serial countdown, cancel works, history folds, friendly coords).

---

## 2026-06-17 — M7 Ship Training (implemented; pending deploy/verify + click-through)

**Status: NOT closed.** Training-first ship production — the spending loop: **spend metal
→ queue training → cron completes ships into `base_units`**. Metal-only, timed queue, no
buildings/shipyard/research/captains/trade/mining/multi-resource.

**Migrations 0035–0037:**
- `0035_unit_costs.sql` — `unit_types.metal_cost` (scout 50 / corvette 150 / frigate 400);
  config `build_time_scale=1.0`, `min_build_seconds=5`, `max_build_orders=5`.
- `0036_production_system.sql` — `build_orders` table (Production-owned, RLS owner-read, no
  client writes); `base_spend_resources` (Base fn); `production_create_order/complete_order`;
  `train_units` RPC (auth → validate ownership/unit/qty/metal/queue-cap → `Base.spend` →
  `Production.create`); `process_build_queue` cron fn (FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED; idempotent —
  only `queued→completed`, ships never double-added); lockdown re-grant (+`train_units` to
  authenticated, `process_build_queue` to service_role).
- `0037_cron_build_queue.sql` — `process-build-queue` every 30s.

**Frontend:** `features/production/{productionTypes,productionApi,TrainShipsPanel,
BuildQueuePanel}`, `game/production/buildPreview` (cost+ETA preview, non-authoritative),
`catalog.ts` +`metal_cost`, `useGameState` +`build_orders`, `Dashboard` composes. Player
wording: **Train Ships / Training Queue / Not enough metal**. Only new action = `train_units`.

**Boundaries:** Production = sole writer of `build_orders` only; **never** writes
`base_units`/`base_resources` (spends via `Base.base_spend_resources`, deposits via
`Base.base_merge_units`). Acyclic Production→Base. Reward logic unchanged (only reads/debits
metal). No combat/world-state/movement changes.

**Verify:** `scripts/verify-m7.mjs` (16 tests) + `verify:m7`; CI `verify.yml` now runs
`verify:m7` (chains m5 → m2/m3/m4).

**Closure gate (pending):** deploy 0035–0037 · `verify:m7` green · M2–M6 regression · CI
build/typecheck · browser check (Train Ships + Training Queue render, train works, ships
appear).

---

## 2026-06-17 — M5 balance correction: pressure decay toward baseline (follow-up #3, Option A)

**Request** Fix the M5 issue where, with no players, every pirate_hunt location drifted to
pressure 100 / Severe and punished new players. **Option A only** (pure decay) — no newbie
zones, no new columns, no Option B/C.

**Change (migration `0034_worldstate_pressure_decay.sql`):** `worldstate_tick` passive
pressure now **DECAYS toward baseline** instead of drifting up:
`pressure += (baseline − pressure) * decay_rate − active_fleets * relief`. The step is a
fraction of the gap, so it asymptotes to baseline and **never overshoots** (decay_rate in
(0,1]). Empty locations return to **NORMAL** (baseline 50 → danger_modifier **exactly 1.0**
≈ M4); hunting still relieves below baseline; future defeat/event pressure can still raise
it above baseline (defeat_pressure remains a TODO, unwired). New config key
`worldstate_pressure_decay_rate = 0.1`. danger_modifier mapping unchanged.

**M5 law preserved:** World State still sole writer of `location_state`/`zone_state`; combat
**reads** `danger_modifier` only; presence is source of truth; `active_fleets` stays a
reconciled cache; cron unchanged (`process_location_state_ticks` → `worldstate_tick`). No
new schema/columns, no newbie zones, no frontend / combat / reward / fleet / presence
changes.

**Verify:** verify-m5 Test 2 changed from drift-up to decay (above→down, below→up,
at-baseline stays + modifier exactly 1.0, no overshoot, clamped); Test 4 relief made
deterministic. M2/M3/M4 regression unchanged.

---

## 2026-06-17 — ✅ M6 CLOSED (frontend depth / player clarity)

M6 browser re-test passed; milestone officially closed.

**Closure evidence:**
- M6 browser re-test passed.
- CI build/typecheck passed.
- Reports now show readable time.
- Round logs show per-round time.
- "en route" was removed from player-facing UI.
- Fleet wording is clearer: Traveling / Traveling to / Returning home.
- Dev-only ship grant script was added.
- No backend logic changed.
- No migrations changed.
- No combat math changed.
- No reward logic changed.
- M2–M5 backend systems remained untouched.

**Open follow-ups (tracked separately — NOT part of M6):** pre-existing react-hooks lint
cleanup · stuck throwaway test users/presences cleanup · danger pressure balance /
newbie-safe zones. **Next:** M7 (not started).

---

## 2026-06-17 — M6 Frontend Depth (implementation record — CLOSED above)

**Status: CLOSED 2026-06-17 (see closure entry above).** Implemented and CI-verified to compile; closure gate is a
manual browser click-through (below). Player-clarity pass over the M2–M5 loop —
**frontend only**: no migrations, no backend/combat/reward math, reads server truth only.

**Created (5):** `src/game/worldstate/danger.ts` (shared display labels +
High/Severe warning), `src/features/map/LocationPanel.tsx`,
`src/features/combat/RoundLog.tsx` (real `combat_ticks` fields only),
`src/features/combat/CombatReportPage.tsx` (`/reports`), `.github/workflows/build.yml`.

**Modified (9):** `combatApi.ts` (+read-only `fetchTicksForEncounter`, owner-RLS),
`useGameState.ts` (+`location_state` poll), `MapPage.tsx` (clickable cards → panel),
`SendFleetPanel.tsx` (pre-dispatch danger preview/warning), `FleetStatusPanel.tsx`
(lifecycle wording), `ActiveCombatPanel.tsx` (RoundLog replaces debug table),
`CombatReportsView.tsx` (link to `/reports`), `Dashboard.tsx` (pass states + nav),
`App.tsx` (`/reports` route).

**CI build/typecheck — ✅ green** (run 27656389298): `tsc -b` pass, `vite build` pass
(92 modules). `lint` is **non-blocking** and flagged 3 **pre-existing** M3/M4 files
(`useState(Date.now())`, `void refresh()` in effect — strict react-hooks v7); none of
the new M6 files. CI frontend verification is required since local npm is unreliable
(see [[byeharu-build-onedrive-bug]] equivalent note).

**Backend untouched:** zero migration/SQL/RPC changes; push did not trigger
deploy/verify. M5-close verification (M5 25/25 · M4 40/40 · M3 13/13 · M2 11/11) stands.

**M6 closure gate (manual browser click-through — all must pass):**
1. Map card click opens LocationPanel.
2. LocationPanel shows correct danger/activity + warning.
3. SendFleetPanel shows pre-dispatch danger preview.
4. FleetStatusPanel lifecycle wording is clear.
5. ActiveCombatPanel shows RoundLog (not the debug table).
6. Retreat/return messaging is understandable.
7. `/reports` opens correctly.
8. A past report can load its RoundLog.
9. No obvious broken layout.
10. No frontend writes to World State.

**Deferred (out of M6):** pre-existing react-hooks lint cleanup; danger-decay balance
(separate small migration only if the UI proves misleading — not rebalanced here).

---

## 2026-06-17 — ✅ M5 CLOSED (deployed + verified green in CI)

Migrations `0031`–`0033` deployed to the remote via the GitHub Action, and the new
**Verify** workflow ran the full suite on CI (Node 22). All green:

- **M5: 25/25** · **M4: 40/40** · **M3: 13/13** · **M2: 11/11** — 0 failures.
- M5 coverage proven: world-state rows seeded, passive drift, register/relief/
  unregister edges, active_fleets reconciliation, double-tick idempotency, and
  combat safely reading `danger_modifier` at a high-pressure location.
- M4 balance confirmed untouched (baseline pressure → danger_modifier 1.0).

**Bugs found + fixed during deploy/verify (couldn't surface without a live DB/CI):**
1. **pg_cron `'60 seconds'` invalid** (SQLSTATE 22023) — sub-minute syntax is 1–59s;
   60s must be standard cron `'* * * * *'`. Fixed in `0033`. (031/032 had already
   applied; 033 rolled back cleanly and re-applied after the fix.)
2. **CI on Node 20 threw "Node.js 20 detected without native WebSocket support"** —
   supabase-js 2.108's realtime client needs native WebSocket (Node 22+). Bumped
   `verify.yml` to Node 22.

**Verify CI:** secrets `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` / `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` /
`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` configured; workflow auto-runs after each deploy and on
manual dispatch. Verification no longer depends on the local toolchain.

**Next:** M6 (frontend depth) per `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §16.

---

## 2026-06-17 — M5 Living World (built; pending deploy + verify)

**Request** Build M5 per the "Living World Design Law": world-state pressure +
danger drift + location dynamics via a 60s cron, **without rewriting** the M2–M4
loop. Strict ownership (World State sole writer of `location_state`/`zone_state`),
combat may only *read* `danger_modifier`, acyclic cron, anti-cheat lockdown.

**Step 0 inspection (key findings)**
- No `worldstate_*` / `location_state` / `zone_state` existed — only deferred-stub
  comments (`0002`, `0008`). Built fresh.
- **Single unregister seam:** every terminal presence transition (escape, defeat,
  safe-leave) funnels through `presence_complete()` → one hook, not six.
- **Combat touches one function:** `combat_create_encounter` starts
  `enemy_integrity_current = 0`, so wave 1 spawns inside `process_combat_ticks`;
  the danger read goes there only.

**Work done (migrations `0031`–`0033`)**
- `0031_worldstate_tables.sql`: `location_state` (pressure/danger_modifier/
  active_fleets/last_tick_at) + `zone_state` rollup; public-read RLS, no client
  write; seeded one row per location/zone.
- `0032_worldstate_fns.sql`: 10 `game_config` keys (no magic numbers);
  `worldstate_register_presence` / `worldstate_unregister_presence` (cache ±1) /
  `worldstate_tick()` (reconcile active_fleets from real presences → drift/relief
  if elapsed ≥ min → bounded `danger_modifier` → zone rollup); service-role-only
  `dev_worldstate_prime` test helper; **edges wired** by re-creating
  `presence_create` (→ register) and `presence_complete` (→ unregister), behavior
  otherwise identical; **combat read** added to `process_combat_ticks` (× a
  fallback-guarded `danger_modifier`, else 1.0); re-locked execute surface.
- `0033_cron_location_state.sql`: `process_location_state_ticks()` → only
  `worldstate_tick()`; pg_cron every 60s. Cadences now 30s / 2s / 60s.

**Balance safety (Rule F):** `danger_modifier` is **piecewise with baseline → exactly
1.0**, and seed pressure = baseline = 50 → fresh locations multiply combat by 1.0,
so M4 numbers are unchanged until pressure actually drifts.

**Frontend (minimal, read-only):** `mapTypes.ts` `LocationState`; `mapApi.ts`
`fetchLocationStates()` (public read); `MapPage.tsx` shows "Pirate activity:
Calm/Rising/Severe" + "Danger: Low/Medium/High" on pirate_hunt cards. No writes.

**Verification:** `scripts/verify-m5.mjs` + `verify:m5` — Tests 1–9 (rows, drift,
register, relief, unregister, reconcile, danger-feeds-combat, double-tick
idempotency, M2/M3/M4 regression). Uses a **service-role key** to drive the locked
`worldstate_tick()`/dev helper (clients stay denied), mirroring the `dev_reset_player`
precedent.

**Not yet run (gated on user):** fresh clone has no `.env.local` and migrations
aren't on the remote. Local `npm install`/build also blocked by a known npm bug on
this OneDrive path (optional wasm deps `@tailwindcss/oxide-wasm32-wasi` etc. fail to
reify → "Exit handler never called", no `.bin` shims). **To finish M5:** `supabase
db push`, add `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to `.env.local`, `npm run verify:m5`.

**CI:** added `.github/workflows/verify.yml` — runs `verify:m5` (chains M2/M3/M4) on
ubuntu after the deploy workflow succeeds, or via manual dispatch. Sidesteps the local
npm/TLS toolchain blockers. Needs repo secrets `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`,
`VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.

**Also:** reconciled README milestone list to the real M1–M6 roadmap.

---

## 2026-06-17 — M4 cleanup (loose ends; verified 40/40)

**1. Reward deposit → home arrival.** Combat no longer deposits at escape. On
escape/auto-extract the pending rewards are attached to the return movement
(`fleet_movements.reward_grant_source` + `reward_payload_json` via new
`movement_attach_cargo()`), and `process_fleet_movements()`'s **return-arrival
branch** deposits them via `reward_grant` (idempotent unique source). Defeat → none
(zeroed). Deferred so future en-route risk/cargo "just works."
**2. Config extraction.** Added `reward_danger_scale=0.25`, `danger_time_divisor_seconds=180`,
`combat_damage_variance_pct=0.10`, `defense_curve_base=100`; `process_combat_ticks`
now reads them. No combat magic numbers remain in code.
**3. Dead code.** Dropped `fleet_apply_losses()` (superseded by combat_units +
fleet_sync_quantities; confirmed no live caller).

**UI:** combat pending note "secured only after your fleet returns to base"; returning
fleet shows "💰 rewards locked (secured on arrival)"; report "rewards secured when it
reaches base".

**Files:** `0030_m4_cleanup_reward_on_arrival.sql`; `scripts/verify-m4.mjs`;
`fleetTypes.ts`, `FleetStatusPanel.tsx`, `ActiveCombatPanel.tsx`, `CombatReportsView.tsx`;
`SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`. Backend: 1 migration. Frontend: wording/types only.

**Verify:** `verify:m4` **40/40** (escape: not deposited; return carries rewards;
arrival deposits exactly once +metal; defeat/retreat-death: none; destroyed don't
return), `verify:m2` 11/11, `verify:m3` 13/13.

**M4 closed — no known loose ends.**

---

## 2026-06-17 — M4 CLOSE (combined final pass; all verified)

**Part 1 — retreat + wording**
- Retreat delay **20s → 8s** (config `retreat_delay_seconds`; UI countdown reads it).
- Report wording "Return movement started." → "Fleet escaped — now returning to base."
  Banner → "fleet breaks away and heads home in Ns." Combat-state label friendly
  ("In combat" / "Next wave incoming" / "Retreating").

**Part 2 — edge cases (verify:m4 37/37):** destroyed-during-retreat → defeat (no
reward/return); retreat spam → exactly one accepted; **destroyed ships do NOT return**
(base = initial − lost, e.g. scout 98 after losing 2); one-encounter-per-fleet; reward
once (idempotent); safe-zone & invalid-location rejected; defeat leaves no stuck
presence. Browser-refresh/offline: all combat state is server-side (cron-driven), UI
reloads from backend — survives refresh/close. M2 11/11, M3 13/13 (no regressions).

**Part 3 — cleanup**
- Dev helper `dev_reset_player(uuid)` added — SECURITY DEFINER, **not granted to
  clients** (SQL-editor/service-role only): clears stuck combat/movement/presence.
- Reward-securing rule: granted at **escape** (combat end). Return trip is
  uninterruptible (no en-route combat), so this == "secured on guaranteed return";
  death only happens pre-escape → no reward. Kept as-is (would move to home-arrival
  only when en-route risk exists).
- Hard-coded values to extract in a future balance pass: reward danger factor 0.25,
  danger time-divisor 180s, ±10% variance, defense curve 100/(100+def).

**Files:** migrations `0027` (wave HP), `0028` (retreat 8s), `0029` (dev_reset);
`scripts/verify-m4.mjs`; `ActiveCombatPanel.tsx`, `CombatReportsView.tsx`.

**M4 is safe to close.** Remaining (low) risk: balance not tuned to fleet power;
weapon cooldowns prepared not implemented; a few hard-coded balance constants.

---

## 2026-06-17 — M4 final checklist audit (all pass)

**Request** 22-point M4 final checklist before moving on.

**Already passing (no change):** combat start rules, ownership/RLS, one-active-
encounter-per-fleet (partial unique indexes), fixed 3s tick, wave transition,
pirate scaling (HP+attack+reward all danger-scaled), player damage (single
aggregate, no double-count), per-group damage distribution, per-unit integrity,
damage carryover, ship destruction, retreat behavior, defeat behavior, reward
behavior (idempotent), combat feed, debug (`combat_ticks` incl. `unit_snapshot_json`),
processor idempotency (FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED), client/server authority, boundaries,
final summaries.

**Needed change:** wave pacing was ~2 ticks for a modest fleet at low danger
(undertuned vs the 3-6 target). Fix `0027`: `enemy_hp_base` 6→14 → easy waves ~3+
ticks, scaling to normal/strong with danger. Added verify cases C (damage w/o loss),
F (one encounter/fleet), G (safe zone starts no combat), pacing assert ≥3, defeat
leaves no active presence.

**Files:** `supabase/migrations/0027_wave_hp_pacing.sql`, `scripts/verify-m4.mjs`.
**Backend:** 1 config value (wave HP). **Frontend:** none.

**Verification:** `verify:m4` **33/33**, `verify:m2` 11/11, `verify:m3` 13/13 — no
regressions (checklist J). Wave 504→320 (dealt 185), 3+ ticks/wave; survivors report
`{scout:7,frigate:2,corvette:5}`.

**Remaining M4 risk (low):** wave HP scales with danger, not fleet power → a
massively-overpowered fleet still clears low-danger waves fast (acceptable/by design);
weapon cooldowns prepared but not implemented; per-unit before/after captured in
`combat_ticks` but not surfaced in the UI debug table. Deep balance deferred.

---

## 2026-06-17 — M4 combat clarity pass (verified 28/28)

**Request**
Combat now feels like a survival loop. Small clarity improvements + fixed-interval
tick confirmation.

**Backend (`0026`)**
- Combat tick **2/4s → fixed 3s** (cron + config; damage keeps ±10% variance, the
  *interval* is fixed/non-random per design). Confirmed fixed-interval model; per-group
  damage loop already structured for future weapon/unit cooldowns (not implemented yet).
- Added `combat_reports.survivors_json`; `report_create` now records exact survivors +
  losses from per-unit `combat_units` (drives the post-retreat summary).

**Frontend (clarity)**
1. Latest exchange while retreating: "Your fleet is retreating — weapons disengaged" +
   "Pirates dealt N damage during disengagement" (no more confusing "0 damage").
2. Pending rewards note: "Locked — secured only if your fleet returns home safely"
   (and not-secured warning while active).
3. Retreat banner: "Retreating — return movement starts in Ns" (ties to M3 spine).
4. Per-unit rows show "alive/original ships (N lost) · HP · %".
5. Post-retreat **result summary** in Combat reports: result, waves, ships returned,
   ships lost, rewards secured/forfeited, "Return movement started."
6. Top line: "Wave 3 · Danger 3 · 2 waves cleared · Retreating".

**Verification — `verify:m4`: 28/28** (incl. report survivors `{scout:7,frigate:2,corvette:5}`).
Boundaries intact: server-authoritative; client renders + retreat only; M3 movement
used only after retreat succeeds; no captain/trading logic.

---

## 2026-06-17 — M4 combat overhaul: pacing + per-unit HP (verified 27/27)

**Request**
Browser feedback: waves one-shot (HP 195 vs 385 dmg), no visible wave progress,
only total fleet HP, unclear feed. Make combat readable + per-unit correct.

**Root cause**
Wave HP and wave damage were the SAME number → a 385-attack fleet one-shot a
195-HP wave. Fixed by decoupling: wave **HP** scales large with danger; wave
**attack** is a separate, smaller danger-scaled value.

**Backend (migrations 0023–0025)**
- `0023`: tick 2s→**4s**; config knobs `enemy_hp_base`(6), `enemy_hp_danger_scale`(0.6),
  `enemy_attack_base`(1.0), `enemy_attack_danger_scale`(0.25), `wave_transition_seconds`(3).
  New table **`combat_units`** (per-unit-type combat HP: ship_hp, initial/alive count,
  hp_max/current, carries over between waves). `combat_create_encounter` snapshots it;
  `process_combat_ticks` rewritten: decoupled HP/attack, **server-side damage
  distribution across unit groups by ship count**, deterministic ship loss
  (alive = ceil(hp/ship_hp)), `next_wave_at` transition, richer event payloads,
  `fleet_sync_quantities` to write survivors back to Fleet. encounter `wave_number`;
  ticks `wave_number` + `unit_snapshot_json`.
- `0024`: re-lock execute (also block anon/authenticated default).
- `0025`: `fleet_sync_quantities` → **SECURITY INVOKER** (Supabase re-grants execute to
  authenticated on new fns and resists revoke; invoker means a client call runs as
  authenticated with no fleet_units UPDATE grant → denied; internal caller runs as
  owner → works). Grant-independent lockdown.

**Frontend**
- `combatTypes`/`combatApi`/`useCombat`: `CombatUnit` + fetch combat_units; encounter
  wave fields. `ActiveCombatPanel`: total + **per-unit-type integrity bars**
  (alive/initial ships, HP, %), wave-incoming display, "latest exchange", richer debug.
- `CombatEventLayer`: meaningful text ("Missile salvo hit the pirate wave for N
  damage", "Pirates damaged Corvette group for N hull", "N Scout destroyed",
  "Wave N cleared. +M metal pending", "Wave N incoming").

**Verification — `verify:m4`: 27/27**
- Lockdown: process_combat_ticks / fleet_sync_quantities / base_add_resources denied.
- A: multi-tick wave (HP 252→37, dealt 215; not one-shot), per-unit HP present +
  decreasing via distribution, metal accrued, retreat→escaped, reward once, +metal,
  return via M3.
- B defeat: 0 rewards, base unchanged, no return, destroyed. C retreat-death: same.

**Remaining:** wave pacing is multi-tick but on the short side (~2 ticks for a strong
fleet at low danger); deeper balance deferred per request — tunable via game_config
(`enemy_hp_base`, `enemy_hp_danger_scale`).

---

## 2026-06-16 — M4 fixes from browser feedback (verified 26/26)

**Request**
Browser testing surfaced issues. Fix before M4 complete.

**Fixes**
1. **Reward-on-defeat bug (critical, backend):** defeat kept accrued
   `total_rewards_json`, so the report/pending looked rewarded. Migration `0022`:
   on defeat (both paths) `total_rewards_json = '{}'`, no `reward_grant`, no
   `base_add_resources`, no return. reward_grant only ever called on escaped/completed.
2. **Integrity model (backend):** added `player_integrity_max/current`,
   `enemy_integrity_max/current` on encounters and `*_integrity_before/after` on
   ticks. Persistent integrity pool decreases each tick (visible HP), unit losses
   incremental-proportional → explains "hull damaged, no ships destroyed". Frontend:
   Fleet/Pirate-wave HP bars + "Latest exchange" (you dealt / they dealt / losses).
3. **Retreat reward-locking (backend):** while `retreating`, fleet takes damage but
   deals none, clears no waves, accrues no rewards (locked at retreat). `0022` adds
   `retreat_started_at`; frontend shows "Retreating — escaping in Ns" countdown.
4. **Completed history:** collapsed into "Completed history: N previous run(s)".
5. **Wording:** "use the Retreat button in the combat panel" (non-positional).
6. **Balance:** left as-is per request (combat still easy; tune later).

**Verification — `verify:m4`: 26/26 PASSED**
- Anti-cheat lockdown (4 fns denied).
- A escape: integrity exposed, pending accrued, retreat → escaped, rewards locked
  (no farming), reward_grants ×1, base metal +once, return created.
- B defeat (1 scout): defeat, destroyed, report 0 rewards, 0 reward_grants, base
  unchanged, no return.
- C retreat-death (6 scouts): defeat, 0 rewards, base unchanged, no return.
- (verify script bug fixed: `.catch` on supabase builder → plain await.)

Deploy: GitHub Action ✅ (migration 0022). Frontend build green (88 modules).

## 2026-06-16 — M4 frontend (active combat UI, display-only)

**Request**
Build the M4 frontend only (no backend changes): ActiveCombatPanel, CombatEventLayer,
combat reports view, ~1–2s combat polling, SendFleetPanel allows pirate_hunt. Client
display-only; combat_events cosmetic; combat_ticks truth/log; keep boundaries.

**Work done (files)**
- `src/features/combat/` — `combatTypes.ts`, `combatApi.ts` (read encounters/events/
  ticks/reports + `request_retreat`), `useCombat.ts` (1.5s poll), `CombatEventLayer.tsx`
  (cosmetic missile/laser/explosion feed), `ActiveCombatPanel.tsx` (danger/waves/
  survivors/pending rewards/Retreat + combat_ticks debug log), `CombatReportsView.tsx`.
- `SendFleetPanel.tsx` — dispatch to safe **and** pirate_hunt locations (danger label
  + combat warning).
- `FleetStatusPanel.tsx` — present hunt fleets show "in combat" (retreat via combat panel).
- `Dashboard.tsx` — renders ActiveCombatPanel per active encounter + CombatReportsView,
  using a separate faster `useCombat` poll. `index.css` — `bh-fade-in` for event feed.

**Boundaries:** client display-only; only action is `request_retreat`; no client math;
events cosmetic, ticks read-only. No backend changes.

**Verification:** `npm run build` green (88 modules, no type errors); dev server HTTP 200
at http://localhost:5173/. Visual click-through handed to user.

## 2026-06-16 — M4 backend: server-authoritative pirate combat (verified)

**Request**
Build M4 backend: active-feeling combat (2s server ticks), 20s retreat, single-resource
metal rewards, 30-min forced auto-extract safety cap. Server owns all outcomes; client
animates cosmetic events later. Strict boundaries; backend first.

**Security finding (fixed in this milestone)**
Probed the live DB: M1–M3 internal `SECURITY DEFINER` functions (e.g.
`base_reserve_units`, `fleet_set_present`, `process_fleet_movements`) were
**client-callable** — Postgres grants `EXECUTE` to `PUBLIC` by default and PostgREST
exposes the whole `public` schema. That's an anti-cheat hole (client could mutate
units/fleet state). Fixed in `0021_lock_function_execute`: revoke execute on all
public functions from public/anon/authenticated, `alter default privileges` to block
future leaks, and grant execute only on the 6 client RPCs (`get_world_map`,
`bootstrap_me`, `send_fleet_to_location`, `request_leave_location`, `request_retreat`,
`get_combat_reports`). Verified denied post-deploy.

**Work done (migrations 0012–0021)**
- Base `base_add_resources`; Fleet `fleet_combat_stats` + `fleet_apply_losses`.
- Combat tables `combat_encounters` / `combat_ticks` (truth log) / `combat_events`
  (cosmetic stream); Reward `reward_grants` + idempotent `reward_grant`; Report
  `combat_reports` + `report_create` + `get_combat_reports`.
- `combat_create_encounter`, `combat_set_retreating`, **`process_combat_ticks()`**
  (2s, FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED, idempotent; one tick row + several event rows; wave
  scaling, power combat, losses, rewards, defeat/escaped/completed).
- Presence `activity_start` routes hunt_pirates→Combat; `presence_request_leave`
  combat-retreat branch. Player RPCs: allow hunt sends (+min_power), `request_retreat`.
- Config: combat_tick_seconds 12→2, retreat_delay 30→20, max_presence_seconds 1800,
  reward_metal_base 10. Cron `process-combat-ticks` every 2s.

**Deploy:** GitHub Action run 27623526054 ✅ — 0012–0021 applied (incl. 2s cron + lockdown).

**Verification — `verify:m4`: 20/20 PASSED**
- Lockdown: 4 internal fns denied to client.
- Success: dispatch hunt → arrival → encounter active → ticks/waves/events accrue
  (danger rising) → retreat → escaped → fleet returning + return movement → reward
  granted exactly once (315 metal in base). `verify:m3` still 13/13 (lockdown safe).
- Defeat: 1 scout vs Pirate Den → wiped → defeat → fleet destroyed → defeat report →
  no return, no reward.

**Next:** M4 frontend (ActiveCombatPanel + cosmetic CombatEventLayer) — awaiting go.

---

## 2026-06-16 — ✅ M3 COMPLETE

Browser click-through passed; M3 accepted. Criteria met: units return correctly,
fleets complete correctly, no duplicate fleets, no console errors, no backend
errors. One UI wording bug found + fixed (`arriving in arriving…` →
`awaiting server confirmation…` once the client clock hits zero, while the cron
resolves; backend untouched).

**M4 requirement captured (user):** combat must feel MORE active than movement.
Movement stays slow (cron ~30s OK). Combat needs **faster server combat steps**
(tune `game_config.combat_tick_seconds`) and **client-side `combat_events` for
missile/laser visuals** — cosmetic, driven by server-authoritative results, never
client authority. Do NOT optimize movement's zero-countdown gap.

M4 not started — awaiting go-ahead.

---

## 2026-06-16 — M3 frontend (Command Center)

**Request**
Build the M3 frontend to click the live loop: base → send fleet → countdown →
present → leave → return → units restored. Keep modules separated; client only
requests + renders; M2 map read-only.

**Work done (files)**
- `src/game/movement/travelPreview.ts` — client ETA PREVIEW math only (mirrors
  server formula; not authoritative).
- `src/lib/catalog.ts` — shared `unit_types` read.
- `src/features/base/` — `baseTypes.ts`, `baseApi.ts` (ensureBase/fetch*),
  `BasePanel.tsx` (base + resources + units at base).
- `src/features/fleets/` — `fleetTypes.ts`, `fleetApi.ts` (send/leave + reads),
  `SendFleetPanel.tsx` (pick safe location + quantities, preview ETA),
  `FleetStatusPanel.tsx` (status/dest/countdown + leave button).
- `src/features/dashboard/useGameState.ts` — single 3s poll loop; panels stay
  presentational. `Dashboard.tsx` composes the panels (Command Center).

**Boundaries:** base UI in features/base, fleet UI in features/fleets, preview-only
math in game/movement; M2 map untouched/read-only; no client-side game authority
(all mutations via RPCs); reusable for future combat/trading/captains.

**Verification**
- `npm run build` green (tsc + vite, 83 modules, no type errors).
- Dev server serving HTTP 200 at http://localhost:5173/.
- Backend loop already proven by `verify:m3` (13/13) — frontend calls the same RPCs.
- Visual/console click-through: handed to user (browser).

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none in build)_

## 2026-06-16 — M3 backend built, deployed, and verified live

**Request**
Build M3 (movement + presence spine, no combat), deploy via GitHub Action, verify
the full backend loop. Keep systems separated; server authoritative.

**Work done**
- M3a migrations `0003`–`0005`: game_config, unit_catalog, base_system
  (bases/units/resources + initialize_new_player + signup bootstrap + backfill).
- M3b migrations `0006`–`0011`: fleet_system, movement_system, presence_system,
  movement_processor, player_rpcs, cron_movement (pg_cron 30s).
- Switched deploy to the free GitHub Action (3 secrets in GitHub UI). First run
  failed at *Link project* — invalid `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` secret; after user
  re-added a valid `sbp_` token, re-run succeeded.
- Wrote `scripts/verify-m3.mjs` (throwaway-user integration test) + `verify:m3`.

**Deploy result — GitHub Action run 27619768482: ✅ success**
- Migrations `0003`–`0011` all applied to remote, incl. `0011` (pg_cron enabled,
  job `process-fleet-movements` scheduled every 30s, no permission error).

**Verification — `verify:m3`: 13/13 PASSED**
bootstrap → base → starting units(100/20/5)+resources → dispatch to "Safe Rally
Point" → movement row (5.0s, dist 12.1) → units reserved 100→90 → processor resolves
arrival → fleet present + presence active(none) → leave → return movement
(return_home) → processor resolves → fleet completed → survivors merged 90→100.

**Bugs / fixes**
- Deploy 1 failed: bad `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` secret (JWT could not be decoded) →
  user re-added valid token → re-run green.
- verify:m3 v1: Supabase rejected `.test` email domain + a Node/libuv exit crash
  (auth auto-refresh timer). Fixed: use `@example.com`, `autoRefreshToken:false`,
  clean exit via `process.exitCode`.
- Email confirmation was ON → signup rate-limited; user disabled "Confirm email".

**Follow-ups**
- A few throwaway `m3test.*@example.com` users exist in auth (each with a base);
  harmless, can prune later.
- M3 frontend (base view, send-fleet panel, fleet status) is next.

## 2026-06-16 — M2 verified live against real Supabase

**Request**
Verify M2 against a real database before M3. Apply migrations (no manual SQL paste,
no secrets in chat).

**Setup**
- Supabase project created (ref `dlkbwztrdvnnjlvaydut`, Free plan, Asia-Pacific).
- GitHub repo `gkwngns714-spec/byeharu` (private) created; full project pushed.
- User chose Supabase's **native GitHub integration** + connected the repo.

**Work done**
- `.env.local` written with Project URL + **publishable** key (`sb_publishable_…`);
  git-ignored. Frontend uses publishable key only (never secret/service_role).
- Secrets handled via local git-ignored `supabase/.secrets.env` (access token +
  db password), loaded into transient env vars, **never** printed or committed;
  file deleted immediately after `db push`.
- Applied migrations via `npx supabase link` + `npx supabase db push`
  (`20260616000001_init_profiles`, `20260616000002_world_map`).

**Result — `npm run verify:m2`: 11/11 PASSED**
- Data: 2 sectors / 2 zones / 5 locations; nested sectors→zones→locations;
  3 pirate_hunt + 2 safe_zone.
- RLS read: anon can read sectors/zones/locations.
- RLS write-denial: insert blocked (42501 insufficient_privilege — SELECT-only grant),
  update/delete affect 0 rows.
- Frontend: dev server up at http://localhost:5173/ for click-through.

**Bugs / fixes**
- Native GitHub integration did **not** auto-deploy on Free plan (first verify found
  no tables). Applied via CLI instead. Future migrations need a deploy decision
  (upgrade for native, or use the free GitHub Action with secrets in GitHub UI).
- The redundant custom Action `deploy-migrations.yml` fails on push (no secrets set);
  left in place pending the deploy-mechanism decision.

**Follow-ups**
- Rotate/revoke the temporary Supabase access token (it lived only in the deleted
  local file, but rotate as good hygiene).
- Decide future migration deploy mechanism before/at M3.

## 2026-06-16 — System boundaries approved; M2 (read-only world map)

**Request**
Before coding, define strict system boundaries (sole writer per table, acyclic
cross-system call graph via exposed functions only). Approve and persist, then build
M2 as a **read-only** world map: `sectors`/`zones`/`locations` + seed +
`get_world_map()` + map screen. No movement/fleets/presence/combat/rewards/resources.

**Decisions made**
- Approved all 5 beyond-spec ownership additions: **Fleet**, **Base**, **World State**
  systems as sole owners of their shared tables; **`reward_grants`** ledger as the only
  reward-application path; **Activity** table-less router. _Why:_ enforces every
  separation law with a single-writer-per-table rule and prevents hidden coupling.
- M2 scope locked to the 3 static Map tables only; `zone_state`/`location_state`
  deferred (they belong to World State, built later) so Map stays pure.

**Work done**
- Wrote `docs/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` (table→sole-writer matrix, per-system
  owns/exposes/forbidden, the 5 allowed call-edges, forbidden edges, invariant
  checklist).
- **M2 migration** `20260616000002_world_map.sql`: `sectors`/`zones`/`locations`
  (static, Map-owned) with CHECK constraints + FKs + unique(sector,name)/(zone,name);
  public-read RLS, no write policies (no client writes); `get_world_map()` (nested
  jsonb, `stable`, granted to anon/authenticated); seed = 2 sectors / 2 zones /
  5 locations (mix of `safe_zone` + `pirate_hunt`).
- **M2 frontend**: `features/map/` (`mapTypes.ts`, `mapApi.ts`, `MapPage.tsx`);
  `/map` route (auth-guarded); "Open galaxy map" link on Dashboard.
- Verified: `npm run build` green (tsc + vite, 75 modules). SQL not run locally
  (no psql/docker/supabase CLI on this machine) — reviewed by hand; first live run
  on migration apply.

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none)_

**Follow-ups for user**
- Apply migrations + set `.env.local`, then the map screen loads live data.
- M2 shows Map-owned fields only (name/type/danger/reward). Distance & travel-time
  need a base + movement formula → arrive in M3.

## 2026-06-16 — Foundation architecture & milestone plan (no code)

**Request**
User supplied a detailed server-authoritative PvE design spec (map → location →
movement → presence → activity → combat → retreat → return → report) and asked to
**plan only, no code yet**, then persist the design as living docs.

**Decisions made**
- **Economy = combat-reward only (Option 1).** Seed a starter base + starter units;
  resources come solely from pirate-combat rewards landing in `base_resources` at
  encounter end. _Why:_ the priority is proving the core world/loop foundation, not
  the economy. Adding production/buildings/training now would build too many systems
  at once and make bugs hard to isolate. Deferred: buildings, build queues, passive
  production, lazy resource accrual, unit training, research, trade/market, cargo.
- **Sequencing = movement+presence spine first (M3), combat second (M4).** _Why:_
  spec keeps movement and combat as separate systems bridged by presence; proving the
  movement→presence→return spine on a harmless `safe_zone` first isolates any later
  combat bugs to the combat system (which the `combat_rounds` table is built to debug).
- **Write architecture docs before any game code.** _Why:_ the spec is large and
  prescriptive; capturing it as `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` makes it the source of truth so
  every milestone (and future session) follows the same modular, anti-cheat,
  server-authoritative rules instead of re-deriving them.

**Gap resolutions agreed (added beyond original spec)**
- `base_resources` table — rewards need somewhere to land (not an economy system).
- `initialize_new_player()` — seeds starter base + units + resources (no training in MVP).
- `game_config` table — tunable balance (travel_scale, max_active_fleets, tick/retreat
  seconds, reward multipliers, random variance) without code redeploys.

**Work done**
- Verified Supabase Cron supports sub-minute (seconds) schedules on Postgres
  15.1.1.61+ → 30s movement / 10–15s combat / 60s location-state ticks are feasible.
- Wrote `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (core principle, world hierarchy, all systems, combat
  formulas, anti-cheat, RLS/RPC, state machines, constraints/locking/idempotency,
  cron timing, MVP table list, milestone roadmap M1–M6, deferred list).
- No game code or migrations written yet (next step: M2 world map, after review).

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none — planning only)_

---

## 2026-06-16 — Rename to Byeharu

**Request**
Change the game name to **Byeharu** (the initial scaffold used "Byeolharu"; user
confirmed the shorter spelling).

**Work done**
- Renamed project folder `byeolharu` → `byeharu`.
- Updated `package.json` / `package-lock.json` name, `index.html` title, README,
  the migration comment, the Supabase client warning tag, and the AuthPage /
  Dashboard headings from "Byeolharu" to "Byeharu".
- Updated saved project memory.

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none)_

---

## 2026-06-16 — Milestone 1: Scaffold + auth

**Request**
Rebuild the PvE space-strategy game from scratch as a clean web-first project named
**Byeolharu**. Stack: React + TypeScript + Vite, Tailwind, Zustand, Supabase
(Postgres + Auth + RLS + RPC + pg_cron). Server-authoritative, modular systems,
milestone-by-milestone. First milestone: scaffold + basic auth structure.

**Work done**
- Created Vite React+TS project at `C:\Users\디폴리스\byeharu`.
- Installed `zustand`, `@supabase/supabase-js`, `react-router-dom`, and
  `tailwindcss` + `@tailwindcss/vite` (Tailwind v4).
- Wired Tailwind via the Vite plugin (`vite.config.ts`) and `@import 'tailwindcss'`
  in `src/index.css`.
- Supabase client at `src/lib/supabase.ts`; env typing in `src/vite-env.d.ts`;
  `.env.example` with `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` / `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
- Auth: Zustand store `src/store/authStore.ts` (session, signIn/signUp/signOut,
  `init()` listener); `src/features/auth/AuthPage.tsx` (login/signup);
  `src/app/RequireAuth.tsx` route guard; routing in `src/app/App.tsx`.
- Placeholder `src/features/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx`.
- DB: migration `supabase/migrations/20260616000001_init_profiles.sql` —
  `profiles` table, RLS (own-row read/update), auto-create-profile trigger on
  `auth.users` (SECURITY DEFINER).
- CI: `.github/workflows/deploy-migrations.yml` to `supabase db push` on push to
  `main`.
- Removed default Vite demo files (`App.tsx`/`App.css`/sample assets); updated
  `index.html` title and `.gitignore` for env files.

**Bugs / fixes**
- _(none yet)_

**Open follow-ups**
- User must create a Supabase project and fill `.env.local`.
- For CI: add repo secrets `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID`,
  `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD`.
- Run `npm run build` / typecheck once `.env.local` exists to confirm green.
